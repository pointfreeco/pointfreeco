This repo contains the full source code for the [Point-Free](http://www.pointfree.co) website, a video series exploring Swift and functional programming. The codebase is split into 3 pieces:

* `PointFree`: This is the core application, and is responsible for routing requests, loading data and rendering HTML and CSS.
* `Styleguide`: This library contains functions and data types for creating a consistent style across the entire website.
* `Server`: This is the actual executable server. It uses [NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) to handle the low-level server responsibilities, and hands everything else over to the `PointFree` package.

## Getting Started

Interested in a [video tour of the code base](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep22-a-tour-of-point-free)?

  <img alt="video poster image" src="https://d1hf1soyumxcgv.cloudfront.net/0022-tour-of-pointfreeco/poster.jpg" width="480">
</a>

The repo contains an extensive test suite and some playgrounds to explore. To get things running:

* Make sure [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is installed!

* Make sure [`cmark`](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) is installed. You can install it with Homebrew:
  ``` sh
  brew install cmark # or your preferred installation method
  ```

* Make sure [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) is installed _and running_. It's our database of choice. You can install it with Homebrew:
  ``` sh
  brew install postgres # or your preferred installation method
  brew services start postgresql # or your preferred launch method
  ```
  (If you use Postgres.app, EnterpriseDB, or another installation method, please follow some additional instructions in the [CPostgreSQL](https://github.com/vapor-community/cpostgresql) README.)

* Open up a terminal window and grab the code:
  ``` sh
  git clone https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco.git
  cd pointfreeco
  ```

* Bootstrap! If you want us to take care of the details for you, we need to install a few module maps in your SDK path to make sure CommonCrypto, Postgres, cmark, and other modules are available to our libraries, playgrounds, and tests. We also need to set up a `pointfreeco` user and database in Postgres. You can read our [Makefile](Makefile) for more info, and run:
  ``` sh
  make bootstrap-oss
  ```

With everything bootstrapped and the project open in Xcode, you can:

* Run the server locally
  * Select the `Server` target
  * Run: Command+R
  * Visit `http://localhost:8080`
* Explore our playgrounds
  * Select the `PointFree-Package` target
  * Build: Command+B
  * Open a [playground](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/tree/master/pointfreeco.playground)!

## Some fun things to explore

There're a lot of fun things to explore in this repo. For example:

  * We develop web pages in playgrounds for a continuous feedback loop. This is made possible by the fact that the entire server stack is composed of pure functions with side-effects pushed to the boundaries of the application. It allows us to load up any request in isolation, including `POST` requests, all without ever worrying about doing a side-effect.

  * We use [snapshot testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) to capture full data structures in order to verify their correctness. Not only do we do this in the traditional way of taking screenshots of web pages at various break points (e.g. on [iPhone](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/blob/fe09eae49835b603ee8083bdfdcee45b3fed81b0/Tests/PointFreeTests/__Snapshots__/LaunchSignupTests/testHome.3._375.0x667.0.png) and [desktop](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/blob/fe09eae49835b603ee8083bdfdcee45b3fed81b0/Tests/PointFreeTests/__Snapshots__/LaunchSignupTests/testHome.5._800.0x600.0.png)), but we can also snapshot any entire request-to-response lifecycle (e.g. the `POST` to a signup page does the correct [redirect](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/blob/fe09eae49835b603ee8083bdfdcee45b3fed81b0/Tests/PointFreeTests/__Snapshots__/LaunchSignupTests/testSignup.1.Conn.txt)).
