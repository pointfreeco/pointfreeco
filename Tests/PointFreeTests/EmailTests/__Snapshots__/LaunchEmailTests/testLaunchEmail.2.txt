Thanks for signing up!

Point-Free will be launching soon, and you’ll be the first to know.

We’ve launched!
We’re very excited to finally get the series off the ground! We first announced Point-Free back
in July, and since then we’ve been hard at work building the site in Swift, mostly from scratch.
In fact, we even open-sourced the entire code base of the site, including the code that sent this very email!
We’ve got so much we want to talk about, but just a quick overview of the things we have planned:
Pure functions and side effects
Code reuse through function composition
Maximizing the use of the type-system
Turning programming problems into algebraic problems


And so much more…
If any of that sounds interesting to you, please consider subscribing! We have monthly, yearly and
team plan to choose from.
Subscribe to Point-Free!
Your hosts,
Brandon&nbsp;Williams &amp; Stephen&nbsp;Celis
