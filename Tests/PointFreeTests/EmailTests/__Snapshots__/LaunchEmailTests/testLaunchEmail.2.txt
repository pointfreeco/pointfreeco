### We’ve launched!

We’re very excited to finally get the series off the ground! We first announced Point-Free back
in July, and since then we’ve been hard at work building the site in Swift, mostly from scratch.
In fact, we even open-sourced <https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco> the entire code base of the site, including the code that sent this very email!

We’ve got so much we want to talk about, but just a quick overview of the things we have planned:

  - Pure functions and side effects

  - Code reuse through function composition

  - Maximizing the use of the type-system

  - Turning programming problems into algebraic problems

And so much more…

If any of that sounds interesting to you, please consider subscribing! We have monthly, yearly and
team plan to choose from.
