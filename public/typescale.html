    <p>In the article “Algebraic Structure and Protocols” we described how to use Swift protocols to describe some basic algebraic structures, such as semigroups and monoids, provided some simple examples, and then provided constructions to build new instances from existing. Here we apply those ideas to the concrete ideas of predicates and sorting functions, and show how they build a wonderful little algebra that is quite expressive.</p>
