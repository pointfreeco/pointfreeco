Join us for a tour of the code base that powers this very site and see what functional programming can look like in a production code base! We'll walk through cloning the repo and getting the site running on your local machine before showing off some of the fun functional programming we do on a daily basis.

That's intense! There are _three_ operators on the screen right now. I'm sorry! But there are some interesting things going on here!
