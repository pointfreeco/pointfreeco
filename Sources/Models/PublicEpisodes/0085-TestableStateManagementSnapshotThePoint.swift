Add tests for VanillaPrimeTime's `FavoritePrimesView`, starting with the logic around deleting favorite primes.
"""#,
    solution: #"""
First, in `FavoritePrimesView`, extract the list's `onDelete` logic into a method.

```swift
func deleteFavoritePrimes(_ indexSet: IndexSet) {
  for index in indexSet {
    let prime = self.favoritePrimes[index]
    self.favoritePrimes.remove(at: index)
    self.activityFeed.append(.init(timestamp: Date(), type: .removedFavoritePrime(prime)))
  }
}
```

Next, pass this method to `onDelete`.

```swift
.onDelete(perform: self.deleteFavoritePrimes)
```

Finally, write a test exercising this logic!

```swift
func testFavoritePrimesView_deleteFavoritePrimes() {
  let view = FavoritePrimesView(
    favoritePrimes: Binding(initialValue: [2, 3, 5]),
    activityFeed: Binding(initialValue: [])

  view.deleteFavoritePrimes([1])

So we've now demonstrated that not only is the composable architecture we have been developing super testable, but it can also test deep aspects of our application, and it can be done with minimal set up and ceremony. This is key if people are going to be motivated to write tests. There should be as little friction as possible to writing tests, and we should be confident we are testing some real world aspects of our application.

But no matter how cool this is, we always like to end a series of episodes on Point-Free by asking "what's the point?". Because although we've built some great testing tools and gotten lots of test coverage, it also took quite a bit of work to get here. We are now on the 18th(!) episode of our architecture series, and we've built up a lot of machinery along the way. So was it necessary to do all of this work in order to gain this level of testability? And can we not do this type of testing in vanilla SwiftUI?

Unfortunately, we do indeed think it's necessary to do some amount of work to gain testability in a SwiftUI application. You don't necessarily need to use the composable architecture we've been building, but it seems that if you want to test your SwiftUI application you will be inevitably led to introducing some layers on top of SwiftUI to achieve this.

The `count` and array of `favoritePrimes` is the core data we want to persist across screens in our application.

In contrast, the architecture we have been building over the past many weeks had quite a few opinions on how to structure things that SwiftUI alone does not. It demanded that we no longer sprinkle mutations throughout our views. Instead, we describe all of the actions a user can take as an enum, and we create a reducer to describe how state should be mutated given a user action. Then, in the view, instead of performing mutations we are only allowed to send actions to the store. Most importantly, those actions very simply described what the user did, not what we expect to happen after the action took place. They were described like `saveButtonTapped` or `incrButtonTapped`, not like `fetchNthPrime` or `incrementCount`.

This dance is probably just a simplified version of what the `@Binding` property wrapper does, but unfortunately we cannot use property wrappers at this scope:

So it looks like we really have no choice but to create a binding directly, not using any of SwiftUI's fancy property wrappers. Fortunately, there is one small thing we can do to clean up the two step process we have right now for creating bindings. We can provide our own initializer that hides this little local mutable value away from us:

So, what is there to test? Well, there is a ton of logic in this view around whether or not the current count is a prime and whether or not that prime is in our favorites:

view.body.

We only see SwiftUI APIs in there for modifying this view. There's no way to actually get access on the subviews inside this view so that we can assert on what is happening. Essentially, everything that happens on the inside of these `body` properties should be thought of as a black box.
"""#,
    timestamp: (12*60 + 45),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
So, if we are going to test any of the logic in here we need to extract it out somewhere else. One thing we could do is move the logic that does the saving and removing of a favorite prime to methods on the view:
"""#,
    timestamp: (13*60 + 05),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

func saveFavoritePrime() {
  self.favoritePrimes.append(self.count)

"""#,
    timestamp: nil,

And now we are finally ready to write our first asserts:
"""#,
    timestamp: (13*60 + 40),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
view.removeFavoritePrime()

"""#,

    type: .code(lang: .swift)

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Just to make sure these tests are actually running let's demonstrate a failure:

There is one thing we can do to regain exhaustive assertions, but it comes with some boilerplate. We would need to introduce a new struct that holds only the state from `AppState` that we care about, and use it for our binding:

Although the prime modal view was not super testable out of the box, we were able to gain testability through a few helper methods.

We can start by quickly taking a look at the `FavoritePrimesView`. It is similar to the `IsPrimeModal` in that it only needs a few binding values to do its job:

So based off of our work with the prime modal, we should be able to instantiate one of these views in a test quite easily. If we look around to see what is testable we will see a bit of logic stuffed into this `onDelete` closure:

We also want to be able to test those `@State` fields because there was some nuanced logic that guides their behavior. For example, as soon as you tap the "What is the nth prime?" button we disable the nth prime button, and then only when we get a response from the API do we re-enable it. We also only show the alert when we get a successful response from the API:

That doesn't seem right. Literally the first thing the `nthPrimeButtonAction` method does is flip this boolean to `true`. Let's try to get some insight into what is happening inside this method by adding some `print` statements before and after the state is mutated :

While we don't know exactly why this is happening, it almost certainly has to do with the fact that this value is stored in a `@State` field, which is what gives SwiftUI the powers to automatically re-render this view when any value is changed. However, it seems that whatever machinery powers this simply does not work unless it is run in the right context, such as a `UIHostingController`.

As far as we know, there is no way around this. Essentially any state that is modeled using the `@State` property wrapper is simply untestable. Maybe you don't care about testing this logic, but if you do, you have no choice but to move it into your application state.

    timestamp: (26*60 + 30),

So let's do that real quick. We can add these fields to `AppState`:

And then remove those fields from our view, while also fixing references to those fields:

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""

We just need to fix a few compiler errors along the way by reaching through the `state` property when accessing this state.

So, although `@State` fields were not directly testable, we could at least extract them out to the app state to make them testable.

However, even with that done we still haven't recovered them same testing capabilities as we had with our architecture. When we wrote tests for this screen with the composable architecture we saw that we could easily add an integration test, that is, a test that exercises multiple independent pieces of the application at once. We were able to write a test for the prime modal logic as it is embedded in the counter logic, just to make sure that those two features play nicely together.
"""#,
    timestamp: (27*60 + 37),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

This is not possible to do currently. Since the prime modal is presented within the body of the counter view, we just have no access to it in our test. We can't invoke the methods we created earlier to simulate what would happen if they user interacted with the prime modal when presented from the counter screen.
"""#,
    timestamp: (28*60 + 06),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

We could probably recover some semblance of an integration test, but it would mean yet again moving logic out to somewhere more testable. Previously we moved logic out of the view body and into view methods, but now that isn't even enough, we probably need to move logic out into the app state directly somehow. But that also seems difficult because we aren't even using the app state in the prime modal view, we only pass down bindings, not the full observable object.

I think what we are seeing here is that there really is no such thing as testing a vanilla SwiftUI application. It appears that you always need to do a little bit of upfront work in order to unlock testability.

- At a bare minimum you need to move as much of your logic out of the `body` property of your view as possible, and either put it in methods on the view or as methods on your state. This allows you to at the very least invoke those methods and assert that the state was changed in the way you expect.

    - But, this is quite similar to what we did in the composable architecture. We decided we did not want to perform mutations directly in the view, and instead described the mutations via enums and wrote reducers to actually perform the mutations.

- If you want to take a step further, you should also think about what SwiftUI features you use to model your state. It is convenient to project out a few fields of your big blob of state into bindings, but if you do that you lose the ability to exhaustively assert how state changes in a test. And if you want to recover the exhaustivity you have to bundle up those fields into a struct of its own and create a computed property on your app state to derive that sub-state.

    - But again, this is quite similar to what we did in the composable architecture. We created little state structs to hold the state specific to a view, and created the composability tools necessary to plug it back into the global state, and because we did that we got exhaustive testing for free.

- It is also convenient to use `@State` to model local state in a view. But this comes at the cost of essentially being untestable. There appears to be nothing we can do to make those values change as we invoke various methods on the view. The only way to gain testability is to move that state out of local `@State` bindings and into your app state, which means converting to either `@Binding` or `@ObservedObject`.

    - And yet again, this is exactly what we did in the composable architecture. We needed to move a few of these `@State` fields out of the view and into our global app state, like the alert state and button disabled state. At the time we did this because the logic that controlled that state was subtle, and we wanted to move it to our reducers. But then later we showed it gave us the ability to write some really amazing tests, including the ability to play out a full script of user actions (such as tapping a button, running an effect, triggering an alert, and dismissing the alert) and make sure the state changes how we expect.

And this is the point of all the work we've been doing on the composable architecture for the past 18 episodes of Point-Free. We claim that there really is no such thing as a "vanilla SwiftUI" app if you want that app to be testable. Although SwiftUI solves some of the hardest problems when it comes to building an application, there are many problems it does not attempt to solve. The moment you start to solve these problems, you are inevitably led to needing to add a layer on top of SwiftUI that Apple has not officially sanctioned or provided guidance on. Further, if you do not construct that extra layer in a principled way the tests will be difficult to write, and you may not be able to write integration tests that test many layers of your application at once.

And so if we accept all that, then we can see that the composable architecture we have been building feels right at home in SwiftUI. It doesn't really go against the grain of how SwiftUI wants to handle our applications, it only enhances it. We are just preemptively moving mutations and side effects out of the view and into a dedicated, testable place.

Further, it gives us a nice mental model for thinking about our applications. Rather than thinking in terms of mutations, things like "increment the count", "add the favorite prime" or "fetch the nth prime from Wolfram", we instead think in terms of user actions, "user tapped increment button", "user swiped delete on a row at an index", "user tapped the nth prime button". This forces us to think about our application from the viewpoint of what the user is doing, and mutations and effects only happen as a result of a user action taking place.
