In the last two episodes ([part 1](/episodes/ep47-predictable-randomness-part-1) and [part 2](/episodes/ep48-predictable-randomness-part-2)) we finally made the `Gen` type testable. We did this by altering the type so that it wasn't a function that goes from `Void` to a type `A`, but instead it takes an `inout` parameter of a random number generator and then produces a random `A` value. This meant that we could no longer just hit `run` on our generators and get a random value back, but instead we had to provide a random number generator. This was a good thing because it meant that in production we could supply the system random number generator that comes with Swift, but in tests we could provide a pseudo random number generator that is seedable so that we could produce the same pattern of randomness with each run of the tests.

However, a nicer way would be to just create a random bump function up top, and then use that in the `forEach`. That way we don't have a bunch of constants floating around whose only purpose is to be fed into the bump function. We can just concentrate on the bump function itself.

However, all that work we are doing to get a random curve is obscuring the point of that code. There is something much simpler we can do. We can use `zip`.

Only problem is that we don't want to use a `Gen` value for the first parameter, because that's the `x` that gets plugged into the function later on.
