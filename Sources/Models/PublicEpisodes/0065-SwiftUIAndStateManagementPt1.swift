Let's make the state even _more_ persistent by saving the state whenever a change is made and loading the state when the app launches. This can be done in a few steps:

* Make `AppState` conform to `Codable`. Because of the `PassthroughSubject` `willChange` property, you unfortunately must manually specify the other `CodingKeys` or manually implement encoding and decoding.
* Tap into each `willSet` on the model and save the JSON representation of the state to `UserDefaults`.
* When the root `ContentView` is created for the playground live view load the `AppState` from `UserDefaults`.

Once you have accomplished this your data will persist across multiple runs of the playground! However, there are quite a few problems with it. Implementing `Codable` is annoying due to the `PassthroughSubject`, we are saving the state to `UserDefaults` on every state change, which is probably too inefficient, and we have to repeat that work for each `willSet` entry point. We will explore better ways of dealing with this soon ðŸ˜„.

To present modals in SwiftUI one uses the `presentation` method on views that takes a single argument of an optional `Modal` value. If this value is present then the modal will be presented, and if it's `nil` the modal will be dismissed (or if no modal is showing, nothing will happen).

Add an additional `@State` value to our `CounterView` and use it to show and hide the modal when the "Is this prime?" button is tapped.

Add a `var favoritePrimes: [Int]` field to our `AppState`, and make sure to ping `didChange` when this value is mutated.

Right now it's cumbersome to add new state to our `AppState` class. We have to always remember to ping `willChange` whenever any of our fields is mutated and even more work is needed if we wanted to bundle up a bunch of fields into its own state class.

These problems can be fixed by creating a generic class `Store<A>` that wraps access to a single value type `A`. Implement this class and replace all instances of `AppState` in our application with `Store<AppState>`.

In Xcode 11 beta 5 and later versions, SwiftUI's `BindableObject` protocol was deprecated in favor of an `ObservableObject` protocol that was introduced to the Combine framework. This protocol utilizes an `objectWillChange` property of `ObservableObjectPublisher`, which is pinged _before_ (not after) any mutations are made to your model:

let objectDidChange = ObservableObjectPublisher()

Now publishers are a concept from the Combine framework that is shipping alongside SwiftUI, and we'll have a bunch to say about it in future episodes, but for now we can think of it as a mechanism that allows us to notify interested subscribers when something changes. For our purposes we can use what is known as a `PassthroughSubject`, which has two generics: one for the values it can emit and one for the errors it can complete with. Again to simplify we will use `Void` and `Never` to represent a subject that emits nothing of interest when something changes and can never fail:
