For multiple weeks we have been designing a snapshot testing library. First we did a bunch of prep work for it by diving deep into the topic of "protocol witnesses" ([part1](/episodes/ep33-protocol-witnesses-part-1), [part2](/episodes/ep34-protocol-witnesses-part-2), [part3](/episodes/ep35-advanced-protocol-witnesses-part-1), [part4](/episodes/ep36-advanced-protocol-witnesses-part-2)). This is where you replace Swift protocols with concrete data types to represent the functionality of those protocols. In doing that we fix a lot of problems that protocols have, and also uncover some fun transformations that are just not possible with protocols.
