In this series of episodes on `zip` we have described zipping types as a kind of way to swap the order of
nested containers when one of those containers is a tuple, e.g. we can transform a tuple of arrays to an
array of tuples `([A], [B]) -> [(A, B)]`. There's a more general concept that aims to flip containers of any
type. Implement the following to the best of your ability, and describe in words what they represent:

- `sequence: ([A?]) -> [A]?`
- `sequence: ([Result<A, E>]) -> Result<[A], E>`
- `sequence: ([Validated<A, E>]) -> Validated<[A], E>`
- `sequence: ([Parallel<A>]) -> Parallel<[A]>`
- `sequence: (Result<A?, E>) -> Result<A, E>?`
- `sequence: (Validated<A?, E>) -> Validated<A, E>?`
- `sequence: ([[A]]) -> [[A]]`. Note that you can still flip the order of these containers even though they
are both the same container type. What does this represent? Evaluate the function on a few sample nested
arrays.

Note that all of these functions also represent the flipping of containers, e.g. an array of optionals
transforms into an optional array, an array of results transforms into a result of an array, or a
validated optional transforms into an optional validation, etc.

Do the implementations of these functions have anything in common, or do they seem mostly distinct from
each other?

In [the first episode](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep23-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-1) we showed that the Swift standard library has a `zip` function for combining sequences, and that it can be pretty useful. But then we zoomed out a bit so that we could concentrate on just its shape, and saw that it did something very peculiar: it allowed us to transform a tuple of arrays into an array of tuples. It flipped those containers around. We then zoomed out even more and showed that `zip` in fact generalizes the notion of `map` on arrays. And finally that empowered us to define `zip` on optionals, which previously probably would have seemed weird, but was in fact a very natural thing to do.

Then in [episode 2](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep24-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-2) we continued the theme of defining `zip` on types that we don't normally think of as having a `zip` operation. We started with the `Result` type, which actually had two `zip`s, but neither seemed like the "right" one. Then we defined the `Validated` type, a close relative of the `Result` type, and it had a `zip` operation that was very useful and clearly the "right" one.

In the episode on `map` one of the things I thought was cool was showing that `map` was not just some handy thing that was given to us by the designers of the Swift standard library.
