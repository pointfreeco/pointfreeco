In past few episodes we explored how Swift doesn't always place structs and enums on equal footing, and in particular, we identified how struct data access is far easier and more ergonomic than enum data access: struct properties can be accessed via succinct dot-syntax, while enums require some very gnarly pattern matching code that results in a lot of extra noise, ceremony, and typing.

Luckily, we found that we can fix this problem ourselves by writing what we call "enum properties": computed properties per enum case that optionally return associated data when the case matches. This simple bit of boilerplate made working with enum data just as ergonomic as working with struct data. But it's quite inconvenient to write by hand, and it's a tall ask to do so in code bases that may contain dozens or even hundreds of enum cases.

So in order to fully embrace enum properties as something we can use in our code bases, we looked to another tool: code generation. We have been building a own code generation tool to solve this problem. It's a Swift package that uses Swift Syntax, Apple's relatively new library for parsing and inspecting Swift source code. Swift Syntax lets us walk over and inspect every token of a given Swift source file, so we used it to look for enums and enum cases in order to automatically generate enum properties for each case!

Alright, we did it! We have a mostly-working library for generating enum properties.

Then we sought out to use Swift Syntax to code generate enum properties, because it's a lot of boilerplate that you wouldn't want to write by hand. Finally we packaged it into a CLI tool that can be pointed to Swift source code and output all of that code.
