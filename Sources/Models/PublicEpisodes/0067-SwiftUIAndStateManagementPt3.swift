We've now got a moderately complex application built in SwiftUI. It's honestly kind of amazing.

To begin with, the concept of declarative views for describing UI is completely awesome. This is leaps and bounds better than how we used to do things in UIKit. It is incredibly powerful to have a single entry point for describing a view, which is the `body` computed var, and that forces us to think of our views as just a simple function from the state in our view to the SwiftUI view DSL values. We are very happy that Apple took this stance on view construction.
""",
    timestamp: (1*60 + 17),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: """
Next, we love that SwiftUI gives us a few tools for managing state in our applications. First, for those times that a view has purely local state that does not need to travel any further up the view hierarchy, we have the `@State` attribute that gives us a simple bindable value such that any changes to that value will trigger a re-render of the view.
""",
    timestamp: (1*60 + 47),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: """
Then, for those times that local state isn't enough, there's the `@ObjectBinding` attribute, which allows you to provide your own storage for the state so that multiple views can all share the same data. This means that any mutation made to the state in one view can be observed by another view, and it's exactly what allowed us to persist state across multiple screens, even when drilling in and out of a screen.

    timestamp: (2*60 + 08),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: """
And finally, another thing we love about SwiftUI is that it is giving a pretty strong opinion on how applications should be architected. In the UIKit world things were pretty loose a lot of the concepts are muddied with interpretations. For example, what is the difference between a `UIView` and a `UIViewController`? They both get user events and can layout subviews, yet some think `UIView`s should be concerned only with drawing the view and all the logic should be left to the view controller. In practice that leads to a lot of messiness because you are often needing to shuffle data back and forth between the view and controller, and eventually you start to wonder whether these two objects really just serve the same purpose.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Further, UIKit gives lots of ways of listening for state changes so that you can update your UI, but they all stop short of creating a consistent way of updating all of your UI from state. Certainly you can listen for notifications, subscribe to KVO, delegates, target action and add callback closures to objects and even subclassing, but at the end of all of the notification mechanisms you are left with just executing a bunch of imperative states, e.g. hide this button, disable this text field, set the text of this label, etc. Maybe some people like how fast and loose UIKit is with its design, but I think it's fair to say that in the vacuum of opinions from UIKit there has been a proliferation of ideas on how to do app architecture in our community, all of them subtly different and incompatible.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

In contrast to UIKit, SwiftUI is providing a lot more opinions on how one should structure their application. First, if you want a view to show on the screen you have no choice but to create a view struct that conforms to the `View` protocol, and render your entire view inside the `body` computed property. Full stop, that is simply how you create views. Then, if you want that view to be able to update dynamically you must add some state to your view, and although there are a few ways to do that, they are fundamentally the same in principle.

This episode was recorded with Xcode 11 beta 3. In later betas, SwiftUI's `BindableObject` protocol was deprecated in favor of an `ObservableObject` protocol that was introduced to the Combine framework. This protocol utilizes an `objectWillChange` property of `ObservableObjectPublisher`, which is pinged _before_ (not after) any mutations are made to your model. Because of this, `willSet` should be used instead of `didSet`:

```
var loggedInUser: User? {
  willSet { self.objectWillChange.send() }

Rather than define `FavoritePrimesState`, we can instead pass two bindings to `FavoritesPrimeView`:

So, this is why we feel there is a point in exploring the problem space of state management, and using SwiftUI as a means to do that. There are some very important problems that need to be solved in an application architecture, namely:

- How to manage and mutate state
- How to execute side effects
- How to decompose large applications into small ones, and
- How to test our application.

So, in the next series of episodes we are going to show what functional programming has to say about state management. We are going to show that with just a little bit of upfront infrastructure work, we can come up with a mechanism to unify our app state, our app mutations, and the effects that can be executed into one simple package. It still heavily leverages all of the wonderful technology that SwiftUI gives us, but it gives us the opportunity to solve some of the problems that Apple has chosen not to solve. And the best part, the solution is not a SwiftUI-only solution. It works great with UIKit applications too, which is necessary for dealing with applications that need to mix legacy UIKit with their new SwiftUI views.
