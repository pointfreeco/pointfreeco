We've now had an entire episode just about functions where we emphasized the importance of looking at the input and output types of functions to understand how they compose, but there are a lot of things a function can do that aren't captured by its signature alone. These things are called "side effects."

Side effects are one of the biggest sources of complexity in code, and to make things worse they're very difficult to test and they don't compose well. We've seen from the last episode that we get a lot of benefits from embracing function composition, but side effects throw a wrench in that.

In this episode we'll cover a few kinds of side effects, show why they're so difficult to test, why they don't compose, and try to address these problems in a nice way.

The output's changed from `"1,235"` to `"1,234"`. The reason it's changed? Mutation. The `currencyStyle` function's changes have bled into other uses of our formatter, resulting in a bug that in a larger context might be hard to track down.

This is an example of why mutation is so tricky. It's impossible to know what a line is doing until we trace back to learn what every line before it has done. Mutation is a manifestation of both of the side effects we've encountered so far, where mutable data passed between functions is a hidden input and output in one!

The reason we're seeing this particular kind of mutation is because `NumberFormatter` is a "reference" type. In Swift, classes are reference types. An instance of a reference type is a single object that, when mutated, has changed for any part of the code base that holds onto or may hold onto a reference of this object. There's no easy way to track down which parts of a code base may hold onto the same reference of an object, which can lead to a lot of confusion when mutation is involved. If our example code were used in an application and a new feature were written to depend on this formatter, subtle bugs could creep into a totally new part of the code base.

Swift also has "value" types. This is Swift's answer to controlling mutation. When you assign a value, you get a brand new copy to work with for the given scope. All mutations are local and anything else holding onto the same value upstream won't see these changes.

We've solved this problem at the cost of yet another operator, so it's time to check the boxes.

1. Does this operator exist in Swift? Nope, so no potential for confusion there.

2. Is there prior art? Yep. It exists in Haskell, PureScript, and other languages with strong functional communities that have adopted it. It has a nice shape that points in both directions and kind of signals a joining together.

3. Is this a universal operator or is it only solving a domain specific problem? We've only defined this operator for `(A) -> A` functions and `(inout A) -> Void` functions so far, but it turns out that `<>` is used far more generally for combining two things of the same type into one, which is kind of the most fundamental unit of computation there is. We're going to encounter this operator all over the place.

It's time to slow down and ask: "What's the point?" We've encountered a lot of effects that introduced complexity into our code and made it more difficult to test. We decided to fix this by doing a little bit of upfront work to make the effects explicit in the types, both inputs and outputs, but then we broke composition. Then we introduced operators that aid in composition specifically for composing effects. Was it worth it?

We'd say so! We were able to lift our effectful code, which was untestable and difficult to reason about in isolation, up into a world where effects were explicit and we could test and understand a single line without understanding any of the lines that came before it. We did all of this without breaking composition. That's really powerful!

Meanwhile, our extra bit of upfront work should save us an immeasurable amount of time spent debugging code that has a complex web of mutation, time fixing bugs in side effects that are sprinkled everywhere, and time jumping through hoops to make code testable.

Side effects are a _huge_ topic, and we've only scratched the surface. We're going to be exploring lots of interesting ways to control side effects in the future. Stay tuned!
