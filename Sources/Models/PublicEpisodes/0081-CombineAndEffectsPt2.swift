    problem: #"""
We added a `sync` helper to our `Effect` publisher, which takes a block of work that synchronously returns a value and ultimately returned an effect. It was a composition of the `Deferred` and `Just` publishers.

Taking inspiration from this, introduce an `async` helper to `Effect` that, given a callback block, asynchronously accepts a value.

```swift
extension Effect {
  static func async(
    work: @escaping (@escaping (Output) -> Void) -> Void
  ) -> Effect {
    fatalError("Unimplemented")
  }
}
```

This function is easiest to implement if you assume the effect is only allowed to emit at most one value. If you want the effect to be able to emit multiple values it will take a lot more work and a deeper understanding of Combine's concepts.

When translating our Wolfram Alpha effect to Combine, we took several steps to handle any errors by effectively ignoring them. Simplify this reusable logic with an `Effect` helper dedicated to ignoring a publisher's errors.

    fatalError("Unimplemented")

Refactor the composable architecture and app to use a `Reducer` of the form:

In the episode we note that while we chose to refactor the architecture with the Combine framework, we could have just as easily refactored it to work with [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) or [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)

Pick your framework of choice (or both!) and refactor the composable architecture accordingly. If using ReactiveSwift you will need to decide between `Signal` and `SignalProducer` for your effect type.

To recap: in the Combine world we have publishers and in the Effect world we have `Effect`, and in the Combine world we have subscribers, and in the Effect world we have `run`. Luckily, Combine comes with a bunch of bells and whistles, though, like `sink`, which works just like `run` on `Effect`. And further, Combine comes with `Future`, which are created a lot like `Effect`s, but with the caveats that they are eager and need to be wrapped in a `Deferred` publisher, and that they can only receive a single value, which means we must use another Combine concept, subjects, to simply set up more long-living event streams.

The refactor is pretty straightforward, with only a few twists and turns along the way. Perhaps the simplest way to start is to simply comment out our `Effect` type and replace it with a type alias pointing to a publisher. However, since `Publisher` is a protocol we can't use it directly, we have to actually pick a concrete publisher conformance. We could use the `AnyPublisher` concrete conformance that Apple gives us, but it will be handy to have our own named type so that we can add effect-specific helpers and extensions to it without polluting `AnyPublisher`.

We need to implement some conformances, so let's see what's required:
"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

We need an `Output` and `Failure` type. Remember that an effect's only purpose is to ultimately produce an action that is fed back into the store. Even if the effect errors in some way, like a network request when the device is offline, it still needs to produce an action. So the effect could put a `Result` value inside an action to denote the failure, but the effect publisher itself cannot fail. This means we should use `Never` for the publisher's `Failure` type:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 08),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

The output on the other hand is something that users of this type need to determine, so it should be a generic:

We added this back in our episodes on modularity when we discussed the concept of viewing a store. We showed that it's possible to transform a store that operates on global state and actions into a store that operates on local state and actions. However, in order for changes to the global store to be reflected in the local store we had to subscribe to the global store and replay those changes in the local store.
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 37),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
So we don't want to repurpose this cancellable value, it has a very important responsibility right now. In fact, maybe we should go ahead and rename it to better reflect its purpose:

private var effectCancellable: Cancellable?

But really we need a bunch of cancellables. Each reducer can return an array of effects, and so we could potentially be dealing with many effects each time we send an action. So, let's upgrade to an array:
"""#,
    timestamp: (5*60 + 23),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
private var effectCancellables: [Cancellable] = []
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

And now we just need to retain the cancellable from calling `sink` so that it lives long for our effect to do its job:
"""#,
    timestamp: (5*60 + 32),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

    content: #"""
However, this isn't quite right. This `effectCancellables` array is going to continue to grow as the application progresses. We are never removing cancellables from this array. So, we need some way to know when an effect finishes and then we should remove its cancellable from the array.
"""#,
    timestamp: (5*60 + 46),

This is possible using a different overload of `sink` that allows us to tap into the completion event of the publisher:

effectCancellables.append(

"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Inside this `receiveCompletion` we could try to remove the cancellable from the array, but we don't actually have access to it here. We have a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, where the cancellable is created by calling `sink` but we need access to the cancellable from inside one of the closures that defines the sink.
"""#,
    timestamp: (6*60 + 12),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
To work around this we need to extract out the cancellable into an implicitly unwrapped optional, which allows us to get a variable for a type before it holds a value, and then later we get to assign the variable.
"""#,
    timestamp: (6*60 + 32),
    type: .paragraph

    type: .code(lang: .swift)

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Now we have access to the array of cancellables inside `receiveCompletion`, and so we can try to remove the cancellable when the publisher finishes. There are many ways to remove a value from an array, such as removing the first or last or at a particular index, but to remove a particular value from an array we have to search the entire array and find the ones we want to remove:
"""#,

But this won't work because the `Cancellable` protocol does not inherit from the `Equatable` protocol, and so we cannot do this equality check. However, the `AnyCancellable` wrapper is a class, and so is equatable thanks to object identity.

It's pretty cool, though, that publishers have a `map` operation. We first talked about `map` on just [the 13th episode of Point-Free](/episodes/ep13-the-many-faces-of-map)...seems so long ago! But in that episode we showed that the `map` operation is a very universal thing, and there isn't a lot of choice when it comes to defining it. Back them we remarked how the Swift standard library comes with two maps: one defined on arrays and one on optionals. Since then the `Result` type was introduced and it also has a `map` operation. And now we even have a `map` operation in the Combine framework. This means that in the Apple ecosystem alone there are 4 distinct `map` operations!

The first error we will look at is in the `wolframAlpha` function, which currently is using some of the effect helpers we built last time, like this `dataTask` and `decode` helper:
"""#,
    timestamp: (27*60 + 44),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
return dataTask(with: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
  .decode(as: WolframAlphaResult.self)
"""#,

    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Fortunately Combine provides all of these helpers for us, but unfortunately it also takes a bit more work to make use of them. We can start by using Foundation's new `dataTaskPublisher` method on `URLSession` to get a publisher that represents a network request:
"""#,
    timestamp: (28*60 + 29),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Let's assign this to a temporary variable so that we can understand what its type looks like:
"""#,
    timestamp: (29*60 + 01),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let tmp = URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Its type is `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher`, which is some concrete publisher defined in Foundation. If we check its `Output` and `Failure`, we'll find the following type aliases.
"""#,
    timestamp: (29*60 + 06),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
typealias Output = (data: Data, response: URLResponse)
// …
typealias Failure = URLError
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Remember that ultimately we need to return an `Effect` from this method, and so if we hit this with the `eraseToAnyPublisher` method we will get a better view into its actual type:
"""#,
    timestamp: (29*60 + 27),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let tmp = URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
  .eraseToAnyPublisher()
// AnyPublisher<URLSession.DataTaskPublisher.Output, URLSession.DataTaskPublisher.Failure>
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
We want to decode this data into our `WolframAlphaResult` model, and luckily Combine comes with a nice decoding helper:
"""#,
    timestamp: (30*60 + 09),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let tmp = URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
  .decode(type: WolframAlphaResult.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
  .eraseToAnyPublisher()
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
However, this won't compile because the `.decode` method is only defined on publishers whose output matches the thing we are trying to decode, which in this case is `Data`. So, before we can invoke `decode` we must map on the publisher to pluck out just the data from the tuple:
"""#,
    timestamp: (30*60 + 33),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let tmp = URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
  .map { data, _ in data }
  .decode(type: WolframAlphaResult.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
  .eraseToAnyPublisher()
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Now the type of our publisher is:
"""#,
    timestamp: (30*60 + 55),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
// AnyPublisher<WolframAlphaResult, Publishers.Decode<Upstream, Output, Coder>.Failure>
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
This is getting close. The main problem here is that our publisher can error, but our effect must return a publisher whose error type is `Never`, which means it can never error. The easiest way to transform a publisher that can error into one that can never error is using the `replaceError` method, which allows you to simply replace any error that occurs with an output value:
"""#,
    timestamp: (31*60 + 03),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.replaceError(with: <#T##WolframAlphaResult#>)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The problem here is that we need to replace the error with an honest `WolframAlphaResult`, but we don't have such a value. We would rather just use `nil` to represent that we couldn't construct a `WolframAlphaResult`, but in order for that to our our publisher needs to have an output of an optional `WolframAlphaResult`.
"""#,
    timestamp: (31*60 + 20),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The easiest way to do that is to instead decode an optional result and replace the error with `nil`:
"""#,
    timestamp: (31*60 + 39),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.decode(type: WolframAlphaResult?.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
.replaceError(with: nil)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And finally our chain of transformations has given us a publisher of type:
"""#,
    timestamp: (31*60 + 50),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
AnyPublisher<WolframAlphaResult?, Publishers.ReplaceError<Upstream>.Failure>
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
This failure is difficult to read, but if we follow it along to its definition, it is `Never`, which is exactly what we need it to be to erase to an `Effect` and return it.
"""#,
    timestamp: (32*60 + 04),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
return URLSession.shared
  .dataTaskPublisher(for: components.url(relativeTo: nil)!)
  .map { data, _ in data }
  .decode(type: WolframAlphaResult.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
  .map(Optional.some)
  .replaceError(with: nil)
  .eraseToEffect()
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And now this effect is building. It's intense, but at least the Combine framework gave us all the tools to get the job done.
"""#,
    timestamp: (32*60 + 33),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The next error is in `nthPrime`, which is calling the `wolframAlpha` effect, but then mapping on it. As we've seen before, mapping on a publisher changes its type, and so we have to erase that change:
"""#,
    timestamp: (32*60 + 50),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.eraseToEffect()
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And now this function is happy. The only compiler error left is in our counter reducer where we use this effect. Since we are mapping on this publisher we yet again have to hit it with `eraseToEffect`:
"""#,
    timestamp: (33*60 + 21),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
nthPrime(state.count)
  .map(CounterAction.nthPrimeResponse)
  .receive(on: .main)
  .eraseToEffect()
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
However, it looks like things still aren't building. The error message isn't great, but the problem is here:
"""#,
    timestamp: (33*60 + 58),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.receive(on: .main)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The `receive(on:)` method takes a `Scheduler`:
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.receive(on: <#T##Scheduler#>)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Which is a protocol, not a concrete type. Both `DispatchQueue`s and `RunLoop`s conform to this protocol, so we just have to be more explicit with the type to use it:
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And now the module is finally building. Even better, the entire app target is building, which means we can run our app yet again. If we give it a spin we will see that everything still works the same, but now it's running off of Combine instead of our own custom effect type. I don't know about you, but the app just feels nicer now that I know Combine is powering it under the hood 😄.

We like to end every episode on Point-Free by asking "what's the point?!", which is our time to bring things down the earth and discuss why these ideas are important. However, this episode was pretty practical from the outset. We noticed that the `Effect` type looked eerily similar to what a lot of reactive programming libraries give us, such as ReactiveSwift, RxSwift and most recently Combine from Apple. So, we wondered if maybe we could lean on one of the frameworks instead of rolling our own type, and indeed we could. The most important qualities of our `Effect` type was that it could represent asynchronous work and that it was transformable. Well, all of these reactive libraries provide exactly this too, so might as well take advantage.
"""#,

But perhaps the "meta-point" of this episode is that by having a very simple, focused type for accomplishing one thing, and doing so in a transformable way, you can later be open to lots of nice refactors in the future. The fact that we were able to completely swap our our effects type for another type, and everything continued to just work is pretty amazing. So amazing in fact that you might ask why can't we abstract over the shape of effects so that a user of this library could bring their own effect type? Maybe they want to use ReactiveSwift or RxSwift instead of Combine, and maybe they want to just roll their own simple type.

Unfortunately Swift's type system is not powerful enough to express this idea, but at least we can see the shape of such an abstraction and try to use it as inspiration for how we build our library.
