We've solved the readability problem of nested functions, but we have a new problem: custom operators. Custom operators aren't very common. In fact, many of us avoid them because they have a bad reputation. A typical encounter with custom operators is within a subset of the idea: overloaded operators.

For example, in C++ you can't define new operators, but you can overload existing operators the language provides. If we were to write a vector library in C++, we could overload `+` to mean the sum of two vectors and we could overload `*` to mean the dot product of two vectors. Then again, `*` could mean the cross product of two vectors, so any choice to use `*` is going to require an opinion and lead to confusion.

We would never suggest overloading multiplication with function application:

Swift engineers that are familiar with these languages are going to be familiar with the operator. It also has a nice shape! The pipe (`|`) evokes Unix, where we pipe the output of programs as input into other programs. The arrow also goes to the right (`>`), which gives us a nice left-to-right reading.

We're going to be using operators a lot in Point-Free, so let's make sure that we're responsible and justify the symbols that we introduce. There are a few boxes we'll want tick before we should introduce a new operator:

1. We shouldn't overload an operator with existing meaning with new meaning.

2. We should leverage prior art as much as possible and make sure our operator has a nice "shape" that evokes its semantics: in this case `|>` nicely describes piping a value forward into a function.

3. We shouldn't be inventing operators to solve very domain-specific problems. We should only introduce operators that can be used and reused in very general ways.

Our `|>` operator ticks all these boxes.

While operators give us this readability, we're still missing a feature that methods have: autocomplete.

In Xcode, we can refer to a value, type a dot, and be presented with a whole list of methods we can call on this value.

<!-- TODO: image? -->

We can even type a few characters to limit the list to a subset of methods, including our `incr` method.

<!-- TODO: image? -->

This is really nice for code discoverability, and is a nice win for methods, but autocomplete really doesn't have anything to do with methods. Autocomplete works with our free functions, as well.

<!-- TODO: image? -->

This is at the top-level, though, so we lose some of the scoping we get with method completion. Still, there's nothing preventing our IDEs from understanding that, given a value and `|>`, should autocomplete functions that take that value as input. Hopefully this will get better with newer versions of Xcode.

We didn't have to open up a new ad hoc function or specify arguments, and this is known as "point-free" style. When we define functions and specify arguments, even `$0`, these arguments are known as "points". Programming in the "point-free" style emphasizes a focus on functions and composition so that we don't have to even refer to the data being operated on. That's what this series was named after!

Mapping over our array with `square` before mapping over the resulting array with `incr` is equivalent to function composition! We can just map once and forward-compose `incr` into `square`:

This is really cool! We can see a relationship that our composition operator has with `map` that would have been difficult to see with methods. Here, `map` distributes over `>>>` composition: the composition of `map` twice over two functions is the composition of two functions over a `map`. There are a lot of patterns like this and we'll be exploring them in the future!

Let's slow down and ask ourselves: _what's the point?_ Why are we doing all of this? In this episode we've introduced _two_ custom operators and polluted the global namespace with free functions. Why not continue to use the methods we know and love?

Hopefully the code we've written today has made a strong case for introducing functions into our workflows: functions compose in ways that methods cannot. Composing functionality with methods requires a lot more work and boilerplate, and trying to see that composition afterwards requires filtering that noise. With just a couple operators, we unlock a world of composition that we didn't have before, and we retain a lot of the readability we expect!

Swift also doesn't really have a "global namespace" that we need to be worried about. We can scope our functions in a lot of different ways:

- We can define functions that are private to a file.
- We can define functions that are static members on structs and enums.

- We can define functions that are scoped to modules. We can use several libraries that define the same function name, but qualify them by the library's module name.

I think it's safe to say: "Don't fear the function."

We're going to be using functions a lot on Point-Free. It's hard to imagine an episode in which we're not going to be using free functions. We'll be building very complex systems that under the hood are just functions and composition. It's really beautiful and exciting to see how it all works and how everything pieces together. Function composition will continue to help us see things that we couldn't have seen without it.

That's enough for this episode, though. Stay tuned!
