    problem: #"""
The current version of `Effect` is "lazy": it is only evaluated the moment the `run` functions is called. Define an "eager" version of the `Effect` type that is evaluated the moment it is constructed.

If you have any trouble defining such a type, consider the fact that in being eager, the work should be executed immediately, but call(s) to `run` may happen before _or_ after the work completes. This means:

- A value must be set at some later time. Value types can only be mutated within a local, in-out scope, so you may need to reach for a class instead of a struct.

- Because this value is being stored, you can cache it. This means the work only needs to be performed once.

- There may be multiple requests for the value of a single effect. Ensure that both calls to `run` before the work has completed, as well as calls to `run` after the work has completed, feed the value to the callback. Keeping track of these calls may require introducing additional state.
"""#,
    solution: #"""
```swift
class Effect<A> {
  var callbacks: [(A) -> Void] = []
  var value: A?

  init(run: @escaping (@escaping (A) -> Void) -> Void) {
    run { value in
      self.callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(value) }
      self.value = value
    }
  }

  func run(_ callback: @escaping (A) -> Void) {
    if let value = self.value {
      callback(value)
    }
    self.callbacks.append(callback)
  }
}
```
"""#

  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
Continuing the previous exercise, improve the eager effect by making things thread-safe. To optimize for performance, you could use `os_unfair_lock` to protect access to the mutable storage that manages the resulting value and requests for it, but be wary of recursive calls to the lock by running the callbacks _outside_ of the lock.

You could also use `NSRecursiveLock` to simplify this logic at the cost of some performance.
"""#,
    solution: #"""
An example of `os_unfair_lock` is below. It synchronizes reads and writes to storage, and runs callbacks _outside_ of the lock in order to prevent recursive deadlocks.

```swift
import Darwin

class Effect<A> {
  var callbacks: [(A) -> Void] = []
  var value: A?
  var lock = os_unfair_lock()

  init(run: @escaping (@escaping (A) -> Void) -> Void) {
    run { value in
      let callbacks: [(A) -> Void]
      os_unfair_lock_lock(&self.lock)
      self.value = value
      callbacks = self.callbacks
      os_unfair_lock_unlock(&self.lock)
      callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(value) }
    }

In the past few weeks we finally uncovered how we want to think about side effects in the architecture that we have been developing ([part 1](/episodes/ep76-effectful-state-management-synchronous-effects), [part 2](/episodes/ep77-effectful-state-management-unidirectional-effects), [part 3](/episodes/ep78-effectful-state-management-asynchronous-effects), [part 4](/episodes/ep79-effectful-state-management-the-point)). It was probably our most requested episode, and what we discovered is that if you want to model your application's architecture in terms of reducers, then a side effect is nothing more than returning a value that encapsulates a unit of work which is then executed by the store. This allows our reducers to be nice and understandable, and delegates the messy execution of effects to the store, where it interprets them at runtime.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

The value that is returned from our reducer was called `Effect`, and it was really just a renaming of a type that we had encountered many times on Point-Free, previously called `Parallel`. It's simply a struct that wraps a function which takes a function as its first argument, sometimes called a "callback", and then just returns void. This allows us to represent a unit of asynchronous work as a value, for example a network request could be represented as an `Effect` value which invokes the callback when a `URLSession` data task finishes. We also saw that this `Effect` type supports a `map` operation, which gives us a lightweight way to transform effects, and we saw that this allowed us to greatly clean up the effectful code in our application.

However, there was something a little strange about how we ended that series of episodes. There is something in the iOS community, and even directly in the Apple ecosystem, that looks a lot like the `Effect` type. There are many names for this type, but the root idea is sometimes known as "reactive streams", and there are implementations of this idea in many open source libraries, such as [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) and [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), and most recently Apple threw their hat into the ring with their [Combine framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine).

So in this episode we want to leverage all of that great work from these communities to show how we don't have to maintain our own reactive effect library for our architecture. We truly can replace our `Effect` type with any of these libraries, and things should hum along just fine. But, for the purpose of this episode we need choose one, and we will choose `Combine` for simplicity since we don't need to bring in a dependency. I want to stress that everything that happens in this episode would work equally well for ReactiveSwift and RxSwift, and we highly encourage you to port the reactive library of your choice into the architecture to prove it.

We've discussed the shape of the `Effect` type many times on Point-Free, first in our exploration to understand the `map` function, then in trying to understand contravariance, then again when trying to understand the properties of `zip` and `flatMap`, and then yet again when we needed to refactor our snapshot testing library to work with asynchronous values. Most recently we gave this shape the name `Effect`, and here it is in all its glory:

This is an extremely simple type. It expresses the idea of a type has the power to deliver values to you whenever it wants. This is perfect for asynchrony. For example:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 41),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
import Dispatch

let anIntInTwoSeconds = Effect<Int> { callback in

This value represents an integer that can be delivered at a later time, whenever the value wants to be delivered. No work is done immediately. It only does work when we decide to run the value:

This property, of not doing work immediately, is known as "laziness". The work is done only when requested. The opposite of this is known as "eager", and there are some small changes we could make to the `Effect` type so that the moment it is created it begins doing its work. This will be an important distinction for us to understand soon.

`Effect` also supports a `map` operation, which gives us a very simple way to transform the value that is held inside:

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
That's the basics of the `Effect` type, but we could say much, much more. For example, this type definitely supports a `zip` operation for running many effects in parallel and then gathering their values together into one value, and it supports a `flatMap` operation, which allows you to sequence asynchronous values together. And we could consider more complex "higher-order effects", which are functions that take effects as input and return effects as output. There are lots of things you can implement with such things, like cancellation and debouncing.
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 33),

But, at its core the `Effect` type is quite simple. So, if you are comfortable with that material, then it doesn't take too much work to gain a basic understanding of Combine. Combine is like a supercharged, beefed-up `Effect` on steroids. It expresses everything that the `Effect` type can express, but also a ton more.

At its root, the Combine framework has two concepts: publishers and subscribers. Publishers are types that can deliver values to anyone who is interested. This is exactly what `Effect` is, but Combine's publishers come with more bells and whistles. Subscribers are types that can receive values. We don't have a name for this concept in our `Effect` type world, but the closest concept is when we invoke the `run` method on an effect in order to make the effect do its work. Combine dedicates a type to the concept subscriber because they support a lot more, including cancellation and demand. Cancellation allows you to stop a subscriber from getting any future values, and demand allows subscribers to communicate to publishers how many values they want to receive.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Well, this brings us to our first lesson when it comes to Combine: most concepts are expressed as protocols rather than concrete types. The `Publisher` type is in fact a protocol, and it even has associated types, and so we won't be dealing directly with the `Publisher` type directly very often.
"""#,
    timestamp: (6*60 + 21),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Because of this deficiency of protocols with associated types, Combine gives us a concrete implementation of the `Publisher` protocol, called `AnyPublisher`. It is very popular to provide "any" wrappers (also known as "type erased" wrappers) for protocols so that you can easily instantiate instances of the protocol without having to make a custom conformance yourself. So, let's see how we can create an `AnyPublisher`:
"""#,
    timestamp: (6*60 + 47),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
AnyPublisher.init(<#publisher: Publisher#>)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Hmmm, it only has one single initializer, which just takes a publisher. So this doesn't help us right now. We are specifically looking for ways to create publishers without needing to conform a whole new type to the `Publisher` protocol.
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 06),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Sometimes when these "any" wrappers are provided there is a way to instantiate them with all the functionality of the underlying protocol.
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 19),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
For example, the `AnyIterator` wrapper for the `Iterator` protocol gives a simple way to create an iterator by providing a closure that represents computing the next value in an iteration:
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 32),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
var count = 0
let iterator = AnyIterator<Int>.init {

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Array(iterator.prefix(10))

"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 17),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
So, what else do we have at our disposal? Combine gives us another concrete implementation of `Publisher` called `Future`, and it comes with a callback-based initializer just like the `Effect` type:
"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 29),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Future.init(<#attemptToFulfill: (@escaping (Result<_, _>) -> Void) -> Void#>)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
This initializer gives you a callback that you can invoke with a result value. A result is used here because a future can either succeed with a value or it can fail. This means we need to specify these types before we can use this initializer. For now, let's just use `Never` for the failure generic to represent a publisher that can never fail:
"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 43),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Now we can just invoke this callback once we have some data. For example:
"""#,
    timestamp: (9*60 + 17),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Future<Int, Never> { callback in

"""#,

We can also add a delay to our future value to make its delivery later:

But also, it seems like a lot, certainly a lot more than just hitting `run` on an effect. But also this is packing a bigger punch. For one it has the concept of demand built in, which is powerful but is also not needed right now. It also has the ability to cancel, which can be done with the `cancel` method on the subscription:

It's very easy to use this method, it basically looks just like `run` for effects:

However, when we do this nothing prints. This is because `sink` actually returns something, whereas `subscribe` did not, and the return value is what allows us to cancel future values from being delivered to our sink.

The type of the return value is called an `AnyCancellable`, yet another one of those "any" wrappers but this time for the `Cancellable` protocol, and if we hold onto it we will finally get our value delivered after 2 seconds:

And now this is starting to look a lot more similar to what we do when we run effects. We can just invoke one method and we get the ability to tap into any value that is delivered from the publisher.

This is happening because the `Future` type is eager, which means that it starts doing its work the moment its created, not when it is subscribed to.

This is a pretty big gotcha, and certainly not something we want in our reducers. The beauty of our reducers is that they are pure functions for changing the current state of the application given some user action, and then they returned an array of effects that would be later run by the store. If instead we used these `Future` types then we would start executing this the moment the reducer is invoked. This would be especially surprising in a test if we wanted to just test how a reducer changes some state, but secretly behind the scenes effects are firing off!

Luckily there's a pretty easy way to turn an eager publisher into a lazy one in Combine. We can simply wrap it in a `Deferred` publisher, which has an initializer that takes a closure that returns a publisher:

Ok, that fixes the eagerness problem, and also makes for an important lesson when dealing with Combine: sometimes things in Combine are eager, but we never want eager things in our architecture. Luckily there is a nice way to turn eager publishers into lazy publishers, but it would also be nice if Combine's architecture clearly called out publishers that are eager.

The next problem with our use of `Future` is that it's actually only meant to represent a single value that can be delivered at a later time. It can't deliver multiple values:

And this is `Future`'s intended design. We could definitely have effects that need to deliver multiple values. For example, what if we had an effect that represented a socket connection.

We could also have an effect that represents reachability, and each time the reachability state of the app changes we could emit a value so that our reducer can react to those events.

So, although the initializer of `Future` looks a lot like our `Effect` type, it isn't quite the same. It seems that there just is no publisher in the Combine framework that allows you to initialize it with a closure that takes a callback so that you can feed it as many values as you want, whenever you want.

Fortunately, there's another concept in Combine for when we need the capability of sending multiple values to a publisher, which can in turn notify its subscribers.
