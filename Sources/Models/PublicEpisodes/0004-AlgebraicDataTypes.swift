For every input, a function must assign a _single_ output. Viewed this way, we can enumerate implementations for the cited functions:

`(Bool) -> Bool`

- `true -> true, false -> true`
- `true -> false, false -> false`
- `true -> false, false -> true`
- `true -> true, false -> false`

⇒ four inhabitants of `(Bool) -> Bool`.

`(Unit) -> Bool`

- `Unit() -> true`
- `Unit() -> false`

⇒ two inhabitants of `(Unit) -> Bool`.

`(Bool) -> Three`

- `true` and `false` both need to be mapped onto `Three` ⇒ we have three choices for `true` and three for `false` ⇒ nine inhabitants of `(Bool) -> Three`.

`(Three) -> Bool`

Each member of `Three`—`.one`, `.two`, and `.three`—need to be mapped onto `Bool` ⇒ we have two choices per case, totaling at `2*2*2 = 2^3 = 8` inhabitants of `(Three) -> Bool`.

More generally, functions from `A -> B` correspond to the cardinality of `B` raised to `A`’s cardinality, i.e. `B^A`.

Clearly there's some symmetry here: an enum with no cases and a struct with no fields. By why does the enum with no cases have no values in it, yet the struct with no fields does have a value? It's perfectly reasonable to maybe expect that `Unit` also has no values.

However can we get intuition to understand why this is the case?

Using our correspondence between Swift types and algebra, we can ask a related question that is perhaps easier to answer. We can ask ourselves, "What values are in the empty enum and empty struct?" and it's equivalent to asking, "What is the sum and product of integers in the empty array?"

Seeing how we can both wrangle complexity and lead ourselves naturally to types that better fit our needs makes it clearer how algebraic intuitions can improve our everyday code. We also see that while structs have lightweight versions in tuples, maybe `Either` is a lightweight enum that belongs in our daily arsenal. Let's not be afraid of `Either`! To be afraid of `Either` but not be afraid of tuples, it's like saying that you're afraid of addition, but not multiplication. Or it's like saying you're afraid of "or", but not "and." We don't program in a way in which we only use multiplication (`*`) and "and" (`&&`). We allow ourselves to use addition (`+`) and "or" (`||`). So let's get comfortable with sum types and `Either`!

We've only just begun on this algebraic journey. We still haven't seen how the type system can represent other concepts, like exponentiation! What does one type to the power of another look like? But that'll have to wait till next time. Stay tuned!
