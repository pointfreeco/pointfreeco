Today we have a surprise holiday edition of Point-Free! We wanted to end the year on a free episode for everyone to enjoy, and we wanted to cover a fun, lighthearted topic. So today's episode will be a little different than our usual ones. It'll be a little shorter and we won't be digging super deep into abstract topics.

And finally we can choose which target we want to add this dependency to. We will be writing our tests in the `Counter` module, so let's add it there.

Next, let's try writing our first test. We could add some snapshot testing to one of our existing tests, but just for clarity let's create a new test to play with:

Recall that we make snapshot assertions by using the `assertSnapshot` helper from the library. It requires a value that we want to match and a snapshot strategy that determines how a snapshot is created and compared with any existing artifact on disk:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 13),

"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The thing we wanna snapshot is our counter view, which can be constructed like so:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 40),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let view = CounterView(store: <#Store<CounterViewState, CounterViewAction>#>)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

But to do that we need to provide a store:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 48),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let store = Store(
  initialValue: CounterViewState(),
  reducer: counterViewReducer
)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And to do that we need to import the composable architecture:
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 00),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
import ComposableArchitecture
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,

let view = CounterView(store: store)

"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Then the question is, which snapshot strategy do we use? We want to ultimately snapshot this view into an image, so we could try:
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 29),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
assertSnapshot(matching: view, as: .image)

However, we don't currently have an image snapshot strategy defined for SwiftUI views. We have strategies for `CALayer`s, `UIView`s, `UIViewController`s and more, but nothing for SwiftUI views.
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 41),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
We could try to create one from scratch, but before even try to do that we could also just wrap this view in a hosting controller, which is a `UIViewController` subclass, and then try out our snapshot strategies on it.
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 54),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Let's create a hosting controller:
"""#,

assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image)

"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 30),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
We can use this handy shortcut that the test failure message gives us to open the snapshot that was just recorded to disk.
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 40),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Well, that's not right. It seems that by default the hosting controller doesn't adjust its size based on the content of the view. We could manually set the controller's size to something hard coded, but a slightly faster way would be just to take the screen's bounds:
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 44),

vc.view.frame = UIScreen.main.bounds
"""#,

Now let's put our test into record mode so that we can record a fresh snapshot:
"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
record=true
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,

    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
> ‚ùå failed - Record mode is on. Turn record mode off and re-run "testSnapshots" to test against the newly-recorded snapshot.

But if we now open our snapshot artifact we will see it has a good size.
"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

But let's take this to the next level by flexing some of the muscles we gained from introducing the composable architecture. What if I wanted to simulate the user tapping on the increment button? As we have seen previously, everything inside the the body of a SwiftUI is basically hidden from us. We have no ability to go in and simulate tapping one of the buttons on the inside.
"""#,
    timestamp: (5*60 + 36),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

However, we control the store, which is the thing really powering our view, and we can easily send it user actions along the way.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Let's write another snapshot assertion, but before we do, let's send the store an action representing a user tapping the increment button.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Let's try it again, just for fun:
"""#,

"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 05),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
So we are seeing that we can basically play a script of user actions in the UI, and capture an image of what the UI looks like at each step of the way. That is already seeming pretty powerful.
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 21),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
But let's keep going, because there are more things the user can do in this screen. For example, they can tap the "nth prime" button:
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 45),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
store.send(.counter(.nthPrimeButtonTapped))
assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Looking at the screenshot recorded we see that the "nth prime" button has been disabled, and this is exactly what we expect since that button is disabled while the API request is in flight.
"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 11),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Now, the API request that is fired off when this button is tapped is fully controlled by our environment (in particular in the line where we set `Current = .mock`), so we don't have to worry about it accidentally reaching out into the real world. We do however have to wait a small amount of time to get the response from our mocked API client, and this is because we used `receive(on:)` from Combine when using the effect:
"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 35),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
return [
  Current.nthPrime(state.count)
    .map(CounterAction.nthPrimeResponse)
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .eraseToEffect()
]
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
This causes a thread hop, which means even if our mocked `nthPrime` effect returns immediately the overall effect will need a tick of the runloop to emit. Once we wait that small amount of time we would hope that we get an alert on the screen showing us what the nth prime is. So let's do that with an `XCTestExpectation` to wait for a fraction of a second before snapshotting again:
"""#,
    timestamp: (9*60 + 12),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
let expectation = self.expectation(description: "wait")
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.01) {

assertSnapshot(matching: vc, as: .image)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
If we inspect this new image we will see that the "nth prime" button has gone back to enabled, which is what we expect since the API request completed. But unfortunately no alert is being shown. Maybe it's just a matter of the alert doing an animation and that taking some time to show. Let's try making the timeout interval a little longer:
"""#,

Let's try tackling this problem by exploring it a bit further.
"""#,
    timestamp: (11*60 + 22),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Because alerts are rendered at the window level, we might be tempted to create a window and slap a view controller into it:

Turns out we can only hope to snapshot alerts if we actually run our tests in a host application. Now you might remember a few episodes ago when we first started exploring testability we explicitly disabled the host application because it slows down the test feedback cycle. Running a test in a host application requires launching the application in the simulator, and removing that step can save a few seconds or more off of test run time.
"""#,
    timestamp: (11*60 + 44),

So, we are going to turn it back on for the counter module. In your own code you may want to split out tests that do this kind of window-level snapshot testing into another test target that runs with a host application, and leave all of your reducer unit tests in a target that has that option turned off. That way your reducer tests can be nice and speedy, and your snapshot tests can get full access to the simulator environment.

And rather than doing all of this messy window management stuff directly inline, let's create a new snapshot strategy that can encapsulate this work. I'm not going to create it from scratch but instead just gonna paste in the final answer:

- We turn off animations when we start the snapshot and turn it back on when we finish. This means we don't have to wait for certain animations to finish before snapshotting, like modals and the like.

"""#,

This is so powerful. We are able to play a simple user script by sending actions to the store and then take screenshots of what the application looks like at each step of the way. We are even automatically running effects in the store and being able to see how the UI reacts to those effects. For example, when we sent the `nthPrimeButtonTapped` action, that causes an actual effect to be fired off, one that is supposed to reach out to the world but we have controlled with the environment, and when that effect is done it feeds the result back into the store, which triggers the alert to show. This is true end-to-end testing!

The caveat is that currently the presentation state of the prime modal is currently held in a `@State` field on our counter view:

We're not going to worry about all the details of how the refactor works, our viewers can check out the episode code sample to look deeper into it. But the most important change in the refactor is the additional of two new actions to the `CounterAction`:

So, this is definitely very cool, but at the end of each episode on Point-Free we like to ask "what's the point?" This is our opportunity to check ourselves and make sure that we are actually making something practical and useful. And in this case, it just so happens that Apple gives us a technology that is supposed to allow us to write precisely these kinds of tests, and it's called [XCUITest](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/testing_with_xcode/chapters/09-ui_testing.html).

While it is true that XCUITest aims to solve a similar problem to what we have done here, it isn't quite the same.

It's mostly readable, but it's a little intense. We can certainly tell that it has some API in order to search the view hierarchy for certain elements, but it's a stringy API. We are searching by the title of the button, which is fragile. If we ever change the title then this test will break. Alternatively we can set an accessibility identifier on the button, and then use that instead of the title.

There are also some strange implementation details leaking out. For example, in order to find the "Ok" button inside the alert, it needed to traverse into the alert (which is found by its string title), and then we needed to know to traverse into a scroll view (for some reason), and then finally search it for the "Ok" button so that we could tap it.

Well, already a test failure. It seems that the alert isn't found when we try to make this assertion. This is because that alert only shows when we get a response from the API request, and currently the test app is making a live API request instead of using our mock. Unfortunately we can't even mock our the environment like we would for a normal test:

- First, it isn't great to be hitting live API endpoints in tests. That is a recipe for flaky, unreliable tests, where tests can sporadically fail based on the network availability, API availability, and a variety of other factors.

Now when we run tests they still pass, but they ran a lil faster, although still about 8 seconds. One thing we can do to speed this up is disable animations like we did for our snapshot testing. But we can't do this in the test file, we have to add more test code to our app delegate:

However, even this isn't ideal. We no longer have a direct way to mock dependencies in nuanced ways directly in our tests.

So, what we have seen here is that using XCUITest is slower, flakier and more difficult to use for this particular test.
