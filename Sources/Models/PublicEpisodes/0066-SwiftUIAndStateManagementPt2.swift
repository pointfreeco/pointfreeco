SwiftUI provides another state management solution in the form of an [`@EnvironmentObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject) property wrapper that, like `@ObjectBinding`, wraps a `BindableObject`, but rather than having to pass state via the view's initializer, you must instead inject the object using the `environmentObject` method on the root view (and on views that are presented modally or via presentation).

Update the playground to use `@EnvironmentObject` instead of `@ObjectBinding`. What are some of the trade-offs between each strategy?

Ok, so we had to do a bit of plumbing to properly get our global app state inside each of our views, but the benefit of doing this work is that now the count value will persist across all screens. We can drill down into the counter, change it, go back to the main screen, and drill down again and everything is restored to how it was previously. So we have achieved persistence with very little work using the power of `@ObjectBinding` in SwiftUI.

The question is now: how do we set the value of that state?

We now have a moderately complex application. We are managing and persisting state across an entire application, we are adding subtle logic to our rendering, and now we have sprinkled in a side-effect that communicates with an external service. But we need to kick up the complexity even more, because right now this is mostly just a single screen app. This screen has a lot going on, but in order to demonstrate just how powerful it is that we can share state across the entire application we should build another screen that needs access to this state. So, let's build out a final screen that can showcase all of our favorite prime numbers, and add the ability to remove the ones we no longer like.
