    problem: """
Determine the sign of all the type parameters in the function `(A) -> (B) -> C`. Note that this is a curried function. It may be helpful to fully parenthesize the expression before determining variance.
""",
    solution: """
Recall from the episode on [exponents and algebraic data types](/episodes/ep9-algebraic-data-types-exponents) that function arrows parenthesize to the right, which means when we write `(A) -> (B) -> C`, we really mean `(A) -> ((B) -> C)`. Now we can apply the bracketing method we demonstrated in the episode:

```
// (A) -> ((B) -> C)
//         |_|   |_|
//         -1    +1
// |_|    |________|
// -1        +1
```

So now we see that `A` is negative, `B` is also negative, and `C` is positive.
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: """
Determine the sign of all the type parameters in the following function:

```
(A, B) -> (((C) -> (D) -> E) -> F) -> G
```
""",
    solution: """
We will apply the bracketing method to this expression, it's just a little more involved:

```
// (A, B) -> (((C) -> (D) -> E) -> F) -> G
//             |_|    |_|   |_|
//             -1     -1    +1
// |_||_|     |_______________|   |_|
// +1 +1             -1           +1
// |____|    |______________________|   |_|
//   -1                 -1              +1
```

That's intense! One tricky part is how we determined that the `A` and `B` inside the tuple were in positive position, and this is because tuples are naturally a covariant structure: you can define `map` on the first and second components.

Now all we have to do is trace through the layers and multiply all the signs:

```
* A = -1 * +1 = -1
* B = -1 * +1 = -1
* C = -1 * -1 * -1 = -1
* D = -1 * -1 * -1 = -1
* E = -1 * -1 * +1 = +1
* F = -1 * +1 = -1
* G = +1
```

And there you have it!
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: """
Recall that [a setter is just a function](/episodes/ep6-functional-setters#t813) `((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T`. Determine the variance of each type parameter, and define a `map` and `contramap` for each one. Further, for each `map` and `contramap` write a description of what those operations mean intuitively in terms of setters.
""",
    solution: """
Again applying the bracketing method we see:

```
// ((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T
//  |_|   |_|
//  -1    +1
// |________|    |_|   |_|
//     -1        -1    +1
```

So now we see:

* `A = -1 * -1 = +1`
* `B = -1 * +1 = -1`
* `S = -1`
* `T = +1`

This means we should be able to define `map` on `A` and `T`, and `contramap` on `B` and `S`. Here are the implementations of each, with comments that show the types of all the parts we need to plug together:

```
typealias Setter<S, T, A, B> = ((@escaping (A) -> B) -> (S) -> T

func map<S, T, A, B, C>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> C)
  -> (@escaping Setter<S, T, A, B>)
  -> Setter<S, T, C, B> {

    return { setter in
      return { update in
        return { s in
          // f: (A) -> C
          // setter: ((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T
          // update: (C) -> B
          // s: S
          setter(f >>> update)(s)
        }
      }
    }
}

func map<S, T, U, A, B>(_ f: @escaping (T) -> U)
  -> (@escaping Setter<S, T, A, B>)
  -> Setter<S, U, A, B> {

    return { setter in
      return { update in
        return { s in
          // f: (T) -> U
          // setter: ((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T
          // update: (A) -> B
          // s: S
          f(setter(update)(s))
        }
      }
    }
}

func contramap<S, T, A, B, C>(_ f: @escaping (C) -> B)
  -> (@escaping Setter<S, T, A, B>)
  -> Setter<S, T, A, C> {

    return { setter in
      return { update in
        return { s in
          // f: (C) -> B
          // setter: ((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T
          // update: (A) -> C
          // s: S
          setter(update >>> f)(s)
        }
      }
    }
}

func contramap<S, T, U, A, B>(_ f: @escaping (U) -> S)
  -> (@escaping Setter<S, T, A, B>)
  -> Setter<U, T, A, B> {

    return { setter in
      return { update in
        return { u in
          // f: (U) -> S
          // setter: ((A) -> B) -> (S) -> T
          // update: (A) -> B
          // u: U
          setter(update)(f(u))
        }
      }
    }
}
```

It's interesting to see that the implementation of `map` on `A` is quite similar to `contramap` on `B`, and `map` on `T` is similar to `contramap` on `S`.

This collection of exercises explores building up complex predicate sets and understanding their performance characteristics.

1. Create a predicate set `powersOf2: PredicateSet<Int>` that determines if a value is a power of `2`, _i.e._
`2^n` for some `n: Int`.
1. Use the above predicate set to derive a new one `powersOf2Minus1: PredicateSet<Int>` that tests if a number
is of the form `2^n - 1` for `n: Int`.
1. Find an algorithm online for testing if an integer is prime, and turn it into a predicate
`primes: PredicateSet<Int>`.
1. The intersection `primes.intersect(powersOf2Minus1)` consists of numbers known as
[Mersenne primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime). Compute the first 10.
1. Recall that `&&` and `||` are short-circuiting in Swift. How does that translate to `union` and
`intersect`?
1. What is the difference between `primes.intersect(powersOf2Minus1)` and `powersOf2Minus1.intersect(primes)`?
Which one represents a more performant predicate set?

Let's explore what happens when a type parameter appears multiple times in a function signature.

1. Consider the type `struct Endo<A> { let apply: (A) -> A }`. This type is called `Endo` because functions whose input type is the same as the output type are called "endomorphisms". Notice that `A` is in both positive and negative position. Does that mean that _both_ `map` and `contramap` can be defined, or that neither can be defined?
1. Turns out, `Endo` has a different structure on it known as an "invariant structure", and it comes equipped with a different kind of function called `imap`. Can you figure out what it's signature should be?
