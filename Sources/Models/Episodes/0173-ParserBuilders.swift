          > Parsing is a surprisingly ubiquitous problem in programming. Every time we construct an integer or a URL from a string, we are technically doing parsing. After demonstrating the many types of parsing that Apple gives us access to, we will take a step back and define the essence of parsing in a single type. That type supports many wonderful types of compositions, and allows us to break large, complex parsing problems into small, understandable units.
