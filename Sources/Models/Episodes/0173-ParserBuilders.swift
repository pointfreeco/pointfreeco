Letâ€™s revisit a favorite topic: parsing! After a short recap, we will theorize and motivate the addition of result builder syntax to our parsing library, which will help unlock a new level of ergonomics and API design.

> Parsing is a surprisingly ubiquitous problem in programming. Every time we construct an integer or a URL from a string, we are technically doing parsing. After demonstrating the many types of parsing that Apple gives us access to, we will take a step back and define the essence of parsing in a single type. That type supports many wonderful types of compositions, and allows us to break large, complex parsing problems into small, understandable units.
