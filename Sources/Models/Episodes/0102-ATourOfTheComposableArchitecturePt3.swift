Alright, we've added a new feature, but something isn’t quite right with our reducer. We are currently plucking a random `UUID` out of thin air by calling its initializer.  To see why this is problematic, let’s try writing some tests.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
We first discussed testing the Composable Architecture many months ago, and we discussed a few different facets. [First](/episodes/ep82-testable-state-management-reducers), we discussed how to test the reducers in isolation. This is a natural place to start because one of the primary responsibilities of the reducer is to mutate the state when an action comes in. So to test that functionality we just need to construct a piece of state to start with, and feed that state and an action into the reducer, and then assert on the changes made to the state. And although our reducers are quite simple right now, in practice they can get quite complicated and have quite a bit of logic in them. So this kind of testing can be super powerful because it is so lightweight and allows you to easily probe all of the strange edge cases of your code.
"""#,
    timestamp: (0*60 + 17),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
But [then we kicked things up a notch](/episodes/ep83-testable-state-management-effects) and showed how to test the second responsibility of the reducers: the side effects. We showed that after running the reducer, which returned a side effect publisher, we could then actually run the effect and capture the data it produced and then make an assertion that it produced the data we expected. This was incredibly powerful because we started getting test coverage on effects, which is typically off limits, and we could even get stronger guarantees about our business logic.
"""#,
    timestamp: (0*60 + 58),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
But [then we took things even further](/episodes/ep84-testable-state-management-ergonomics). We showed how to marry the reducer testing and the effect testing into one cohesive, ergonomic package. We built an assertion helper that allowed us to describe a series of steps that the user takes in the application, and each step of the way had to describe exactly how the state was mutated and describe what events were fed back into the system from effects. We could even make exhaustive assertions about effects, such as they must all complete by the end of the assertion so that we know definitively that no other data was fed into the application that we might be missing.
"""#,
    timestamp: (1*60 + 27),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And so we are now going to use that to write some really nice tests for our application. We have refined the API for the assertion helper a bit for the library, but it’s still quite similar to what we covered in episodes.

Let’s get our feet wet by first writing a test for the functionality of marking a todo as completed. You start by creating a test store that holds onto the domain that you want to test, which looks almost identical to how you create a normal store:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 18),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

import ComposableArchitectureTestSupport

      reducer: appReducer,
      environment: AppEnvironment()
    )
  }
}
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Since this episode was recorded, the `ComposableArchitectureTestSupport` module has merged into `ComposableArchitecture`. You can now import `ComposableArchitecture` in your test targets to access the test store.
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .correction
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
However, the `TestStore` requires both the state and the actions of our domain to be equatable so that we can properly assert on how the system evolves. `AppState`  is already equatable, so we just need to make `AppAction` equatable:
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 5),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
enum TodoAction: Equatable {
  ...

struct AppState: Equatable {
  ...

"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Now tests are building, but in order to test completing a todo, we should have one defined in state:
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 29),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
func testCompletingTodo() {
  let store = TestStore(
    initialState: AppState(
      todos: [
        Todo(
          description: "Milk",
          id: UUID(uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")!,
          isComplete: false
        )
      ]
    ),
    reducer: appReducer,
    environment: AppEnvironment()
  )
}
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Now we’re ready to write our assertion. We do this by calling the `assert` method on the store, which allows us to feed a series of user actions in so that we can then assert on how the system evolved:
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 42),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
store.assert(
)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Technically this test is passing because we haven’t sent any actions and therefore the system hasn’t changed at all!
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 58),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
So, let’s send an action to simulate the idea of the user tapping on the checkbox on the first todo item:
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 9),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
store.assert(
  .send(.todo(index: 0, action: .checkboxTapped))
)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Sending the action is only half the story for making this assertion. We also need to describe how the state changed after this action was sent to the store. The way we do that is open up a trailing closure on this `.send` command, and make the mutations we expect to happen to the value passed to the closure.
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 24),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
In particular, we expect the first todo’s `isComplete` field to switch to `true`:
"""#,
    timestamp: (4*60 + 40),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
store.assert(

And if we run the tests they pass.
"""#,

Before moving on, let’s show off a wonderful bit of testing ergonomics that we added to the library that wasn’t covered in the episodes. When a test fails we print a nice message showing exactly what piece of state does not match. So let’s purposely change this test to fail:
"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

store.assert(

"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And if we run this test we will get a failure, and the failure message will show us exactly what went wrong:

Let’s flip the boolean back to `true` so that we can get things passing again:

Now let’s try to write a test for the only other piece of functionality in our reducer: adding a todo. For this test we can start with a test store that has no todos in its initial state:

"""#,

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

We want to assert that when the `addTodoButtonTapped` action is sent that the state changes by adding a todo to the array of todos in our app state:

Well that’s a bummer. We see here that the ids of the todos don’t match. And in fact, they will never match. If we run the test again we will see the error message changes because an entirely different `UUID` was created.

The true problem here is that we have a dependency on `UUID` in our reducer that is not properly controlled.

The environment is the place to put all of the dependencies that our reducer needs to do its job. That can include API clients, analytics clients, date initializers and yes even `UUID` initializers.

But, just before doing that we can handle any action in the `todo` case that we want. In particular, we want to know when a `.checkboxTapped` action is sent, so we can destructure that one event and this is where we will do our sorting logic:

A naive way to do the sort is to use the `sort` method and say that the first todo comes before the second todo if it the first is incomplete and the second is completed:

This technically works, but it isn’t right. The standard library sort method is not what is known as a “stable” sort. This means that two todos for which this condition returns `false` are not guaranteed to stay in the same order relative to each other. In particular, after this sort all the completed todos could be shuffled around, and all the incomplete todos could be shuffled. It doesn’t necessarily happen, but it isn’t guaranteed to not happen so we should assume that eventually it will.

Luckily there’s a small thing we can do to emulate a stable sort. If we keep track of the integer offset of each element, then when the `isComplete` condition above is `false` we can fallback to checking their offsets:

It says that when you hand a mutable value to a function via `inout` that it must make all of its mutations to the value in the scope of that function.

We can very easily fix both of these problems by creating a dedicated type for the cancellation identifier. All it takes is a new struct that conforms to `Hashable`:
"""#,
    timestamp: (31*60 + 2),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
case .todo(index: _, action: .checkboxTapped):
  struct CancelDelayId: Hashable {}

  return Effect(value: .todoDelayCompleted)
    .delay(for: 1, scheduler: environment.mainQueue)
    .eraseToEffect()
    .cancellable(id: CancelDelayId(), cancelInFlight: true)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
Not only can we define the struct locally inside the action case, which means it isn’t visible to anyone outside this local scope, but it also makes it completely unique so it is impossible for anyone else to trample over this identifier. And because it’s a type it is impossible to accidentally misspell, and so we have solved all the problems with using stringy identifiers, and this makes cancellation of effects a super understandable and safe thing to do.

So impressively enough, we now have the functionality we sought out to have, and we were able to do so by leveraging Combine and some very simple helpers that come with the Composable Architecture.

Since we’ve now implemented some new functionality into our application, we should probably write some tests to prove that it works the way we expect…next time!
