The `zip` function comes with the Swift standard library, but its utility goes far beyond what we can see there. Turns out, `zip` generalizes a function that we are all familiar with, and it can unify many seemingly disparate concepts. Today we begin a multipart journey into exploring the power behind `zip`.

In this episode we came across closures of the form `{ ($0, $1.0, $1.1) }` a few times in order to unpack a
tuple of the form `(A, (B, C))` to `(A, B, C)`. Create a few overloaded functions named `unpack` to automate
this.

Define `zip4`, `zip5`, `zip4(with:)` and `zip5(with:)` on arrays and optionals. Bonus:
[learn](https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/) how to use Apple's `gyb` tool to generate higher-arity overloads.

  .init(problem: """
Do you think `zip2` can be seen as a kind of associative infix operator? For example, is it true that
`zip(xs, zip(ys, zs)) == zip(zip(xs, ys), zs)`? If it's not strictly true, can you define an equivalence
between them?

Define `unzip2` on arrays, which does the opposite of `zip2: ([(A, B)]) -> ([A], [B])`. Can you think of any
applications of this function?
"""),

  .init(problem: """
It turns out, that unlike the `map` function, `zip2` is not uniquely defined. A single type can have multiple,
completely different `zip2` functions. Can you find another `zip2` on arrays that is different from the one
we defined? How does it differ from our `zip2` and how could it be useful?

Define `zip2` on the result type: `(Result<A, E>, Result<B, E>) -> Result<(A, B), E>`. Is there more than one
possible implementation? Also define `zip3`, `zip2(with:)` and `zip3(with:)`.

Is there anything that seems wrong or ‚Äúoff‚Äù about your implementation? If so, it
will be improved in the next episode üòÉ.

  .init(problem: """
In [previous](/episodes/ep14-contravariance) episodes we've considered the type that simply wraps a function,
and let's define it as `struct Func<R, A> { let apply: (R) -> A }`. Show that this type supports a `zip2`
function on the `A` type parameter. Also define `zip3`, `zip2(with:)` and `zip3(with:)`.

  .init(problem: """
The nested type `[A]? = Optional<Array<A>>` is composed of two containers, each of which has their own
`zip2` function. Can you define `zip2` on this nested container that somehow involves each of the `zip2`'s
on the container types?
