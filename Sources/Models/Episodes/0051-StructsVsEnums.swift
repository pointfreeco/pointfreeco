Name a more iconic duo... We'll wait. Structs and enums go together like peanut butter and jelly, or multiplication and addition. One's no more important than the other: they're completely complementary. This week we'll explore how features on one may surprisingly manifest themselves on the other.

Swift enums are sometimes called "tagged unions" because each case is "tagged" with a name. For instance, `Optional` tags its wrapped value with the `some` case, and tags the absence of a value with `none`. This is in contrast to "union" types, which merely describe the idea of choosing between many types, _e.g._ an optional string can be expressed as `string | void`, and a number _or_ a string can be expressed as `number | string`.

What can an tagged union do that a union _can't_ do? How might `string | void | void` be evaluated as a union _vs._ how might it be represented as an enum?
