We think this is pretty incredible. We only added about 50 lines of library code, consisting of a new type, a higher-order reducer, and a few helpers, and we now have a really robust solution to simple and complex forms in the Composable Architecture. We are free to add as many controls to this screen as we want, and we will not incur any additional boilerplate. The bindings will automatically update the corresponding state without us needing to do anything, but if we want to layer on some additional logic we simply need to destructure the key path we are interested in.

So we believe we have truly we have created the tools for dealing with forms in SwiftUI in a concise manner. But on Point-Free we like to end every series of episodes by asking "what's the point?" This gives us a chance to bring abstract concepts down to earth and show some real world applications. This time we were rooted in reality from the very beginning because we started by showing that the Composable Architecture had a boilerplate problem. Then we explored a theoretical Swift feature that could help solve the boilerplate problem, that of enum cases with generics. But, even without that theoretical feature we are able to approximate it with type-erasure, and so this is a really great, real world demonstration of how to use type-erasure.

Now we can start converting our form actions over to take advantage of this form machinery. We‚Äôll start with some of the simpler actions. For example, in the accessibility settings we can toggle gyroscope motion and haptics, and both of those bindings do the simplest kind of state mutation with no effects. We can get rid of those actions:
"""#,
      timestamp: (10*60 + 29),

    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
And in the reducer, rather than having a `case` statement for each of those actions, we can instead destructure the `.form` case to match against the key path of the property that was changed. For example, instead of matching against `.toggleEnableGyroMotion` we can just check when the form updates the `\.userSettings.enableGyroMotion` key path:
"""#,
      timestamp: (10*60 + 50),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Further, the `.form` higher-order reducer has already taken care of this mutation for us, so there‚Äôs no reason to do this:
"""#,

      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
But now we see that this action actually has no additional logic in it. All that we need to do is update the state, so this means we can just get rid of the entire statement:

But before moving on, let‚Äôs take advantage of the hyper modularization we have employed in this project. There‚Äôs no longer a need to to build the full app target since we are only dealing with settings-related things. Even though Swift is pretty good about incremental compilation, there are a lot of things that can cause Swift to rebuild the entire target from scratch, such as if you needed to briefly switch to another branch to check something out. Doing so will cause you to incur the full 40 second build time when you come back.

We now run just this one screen as an Xcode preview, and switch these toggles on and off.

This isn't yet building because our form action initializer is currently constrained to values that are `Hashable`, but `SettingsAction` does not conform to `Hashable`.
