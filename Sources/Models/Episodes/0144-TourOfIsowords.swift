        So this is pretty amazing. By using the Composable Architecture we have a nice, data-oriented description of all the actions that can happen in our application, and that makes it trivial to replay a script of user actions to emulate what it‚Äôs like for someone to actually play the game. And even better, creating this autonomously running trailer looks no different than any other feature we have built in this application. It consists of some domain, a reducer for the logic, and a view. We didn‚Äôt have to hack in any escape hatches or litter our core game code with weird logic just to support the trailer. It just all came basically for free. And we could even write tests for the trailer if we really wanted to, but we haven‚Äôt gone that far yet üòÅ

        Perhaps the main reason to write server code in Swift is the hope that you can share code between the client and server. This can be difficult to do in practice, but it is absolutely possible.

            Now you may be wondering why this module is included in the shared modules. After all, it seems to be purely a server concern of parsing requests. Well, this module is pulling double duty, because just as there are times we want to parse an incoming request for the server to process there are also times we want to generate a request to send to the server. In particular, the iOS client needs to construct API requests so that it can actually load some data from the server.

            These are two sides of the same coin, and the code to accomplish both tasks lives in one place, which we call the `ServerRouter` module. We‚Äôll take a deeper look into this in a moment.

        We can then back up a level and look at the data type that defines a single cube in the puzzle by visiting the `Cube.swift` file:

        Zooming out one more level we come to the `Puzzle.swift` file which defines the data type for an entire isowords puzzle:
