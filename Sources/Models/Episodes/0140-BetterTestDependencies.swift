A major source of complexity in our applications is asynchrony. It is a side effect that is easy to overlook and can make testing more difficult and less reliable. We will explore the problem and come to a solution using Combine schedulers.

This can be done exactly the same as we did for `failing` schedulers last week!

With cancellation implemented in the UI, it'd be nice to be able to see it working in the preview. To do so, introduce a `badWifi` weather client, which slows each of its endpoints down by several seconds.

What happens to the UI if we cancel things before the first API request to fetch locations succeeds? What happens to the UI if we cancel things _after_ it succeeds? How might we improve the user experience?
