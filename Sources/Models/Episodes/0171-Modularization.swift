Over the last 11 episodes we have built up a pretty complex application in order to dive deep into the concepts of navigation. We discovered many new tools along the way that allow us to fully drive navigation off of state, including binding transformations, new overloads on existing SwiftUI Navigation APIs, and even all new SwiftUI views that aid in navigation. And most recently we even applied some of these concepts to UIKit to show how its navigation can also be purely driven off of state.

When we finished the series of episodes we realized that the application we built actually serves as a really great example of something we've talked about quite a bit on Point-Free, and that's modularity. In past episodes we have shown how to split an application into many modules, and many months ago we even open sourced an entire application, called [isowords](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords), which was hyper-modularized into 86 (!) different modules. There are a ton of benefits to doing this, such as improved build times, stronger boundaries between unrelated components, the ability to run small pieces of the application in isolation, and more.

To begin with, what is modularity? When we say "modularity" we mean a very specific thing, and that is code put into Swift modules so that we can explicitly describe a public interface that is accessible from the outside. It may be hard to remember, but before the days of SPM it was laborious to create modules, and so we may have instead "modularized" by grouping related code files into directories and creating some kind of system of folders for organizing a code base. But none of that enforces the boundaries between parts of your code base, and so it isn't too helpful beyond simple organization. So when we say "module" we literally mean Swift modules.
"""#,
      timestamp: (1*60 + 40),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
With the definition of modularity out of the way, let's discuss two important types of modularity in a code base. One of these styles is very easy to get started with but it makes a relatively small impact on your code base, whereas the other can be quite difficult to achieve but has the biggest impact.
"""#,
      timestamp: (2*60 + 21),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
The first style is to extract out commonly used code out of the main application target and into a module on its own. An example of this is the models in your application. Ideally the model layer of your application is just a bunch of simple structs representing plain data. Models tend to have the fewest dependencies on other parts of your application, and so they are the easiest to extract out into their own module.
"""#,
      timestamp: (2*60 + 39),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Another good example is "helper" code. Any moderately complex iOS application naturally builds up a suite of helper code, such as extensions on standard library types, reusable SwiftUI view components, and more. This type of code also tends to have no external dependencies and so it is also typically easy to extract into its own module.
"""#,
      timestamp: (2*60 + 59),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Library code such as API clients, analytics clients, etc., are another example of common, "cross-cutting" code that can typically be easily extracted into modules.
"""#,
      timestamp: (3*60 + 22),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
So, extracting out these kinds of modules can be useful, but their impact on the healthiness of your code base is quite limited. You probably aren't going to get a significant boost in compile times with these modules, as the code in models and helpers doesn't grow at the same rate as the actual feature code in your application. Also, extracting out these kinds of modules doesn't help a lot in enforcing stronger boundaries between parts of your code. It can certainly be nice to isolate model code from feature code, but that kind of boundary isn't as important as being able to create a boundary between independent features of your application, like say between a search feature and a user profile feature.
"""#,
      timestamp: (3*60 + 35),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Even though model and helper modularity has limitations, it is still a pre-requisite for the second, more powerful, albeit more difficult, style of modularity, which we call "feature" modularity. This is where you take everything that defines a single, atomic feature of your application and bundle it up into a module.
"""#,
      timestamp: (4*60 + 15),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Some natural candidates for this type of modularity are full screen views of your application. For example, if you were making a social photo application you could think of the activity feed as a single feature, the photo detail as another feature, the search screen as a feature, the profile, settings, and more. Even things that are not full screen views can be features, such as if you have a row in a list with some particularly complex behavior.
"""#,
      timestamp: (4*60 + 33),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
As an example, in our isowords application we have 17 dedicated feature modules, such as a daily challenge feature, a game feature, a leaderboard feature, a multiplayer feature, an onboarding feature, an upgrade feature for handling in-app purchases, and more. The benefits of these feature modules are numerous. We can build a feature in full isolation without building anything that is not necessary. This can greatly cut down compile times, maximize how often you perform incremental builds, and minimize the number of times you must perform a full build from scratch.
"""#,
      timestamp: (5*60 + 1),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
Further, having many independent feature modules can help Swift be smarter about how it compiles multiple things in parallel. For example, the game feature and leaderboard feature are pretty hefty modules, but they are completely independent, and so ostensibly they can be built in parallel.
"""#,
      timestamp: (5*60 + 33),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
And lastly, these feature modules enforce very strong boundaries between different parts of your application. A module is simply not allowed to access the types and functions of another module unless it has an explicit dependency on that module. This can help you uncover potential problems in your code base if suddenly a module needs to start depending on another module that is completely unrelated. For example, it would be quite strange if the leaderboard feature needed to depend on the onboarding feature. If we find ourselves in a situation where the leaderboard feature does need access from some things in onboarding, then it either means we should extract out some code from onboarding into a third module that both can depend on, or it could mean we are approaching our problem in the wrong way and there's a higher level of abstraction that needs to happen.

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

Although the feature style of modularity is very powerful, it's also typically the most difficult to get into place in a code base. Code bases that weren't built with modularity in mind from the beginning tend to have a lot of hidden, implicit dependencies between parts of the code, meaning you have to perform some upfront work to dis-entangle things before you can even think about modularizing.

Let's start by deciding how we want to add modules to our existing Xcode project. We could support additional modules by adding new targets to the project, but that is really cumbersome. Each new target comes with a bunch of baggage, such as huge changes to the Xcode project file, which means more chances for merge conflicts, an "Info.plist" file, and more. We could also try out a third party tool for managing multiple targets in an Xcode project, such as [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) or [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), but introducing a dependency like that should not be taken lightly and should be heavily discussed with your team.

Now technically we have two different Xcode projects available to us.

So, we have now completed the simplest kind of modularity one can do in a code base. We have extracted out models and some helpers into their own modules.

These features are usually the leaf nodes of your application's navigation. Screens that you can navigate to, but that don't have any (or many) places to navigate to next.
