While we've seen that each reducer we've written is super modular, and we were easily able to extract each one into a separate framework, our views are still far from modular. This week we address this by considering: what does it mean to transform the state a view has access to?

  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
Another way to isolate code is to move it to its own file and mark part of it `private` or `fileprivate`. How does this kind of modularization differ from using an actual Swift module?
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
In this episode we discussed how it was not appropriate to give the name `map` to the transformation we defined on `Store` due to the trickiness of reference types. Let's explore defining `map` on another type with reference semantics.

Previously on Point-Free, we defined a `Lazy` type as a struct around a function that returns a value:

```swift
struct Lazy<A> {
  let run: () -> A
}
```

Upgrade this struct to a class so that we can introduce memoization. A call to `run` should perform the given closure and cache the return value so that any repeat calls to `run` can immediately return this cached value. It should behave as follows:

``` swift
import Foundation

let slow = Lazy<Int> {
  sleep(1)
  return 1
}
slow.run() // Returns `1` after a second
slow.run() // Returns `1` immediately
```

From here, define `map` on `Lazy`:

```swift
extension Lazy {
  func map<B>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> B) -> Lazy<B> {
    fatalError("Unimplemented")
  }
}
```

Given our discussion around `map` on the `Store` type, is it appropriate to call this function `map`?
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
Sometimes it can be useful to `view` into a store so that it removes all access to the underlying state of the store. For example, a "debug" screen for your app could have a UI for listing out every single action in your application as buttons, and tapping the button will send the action to the store. Such a screen doesn't need any access to the app state.

Try building such a screen, and provide it `view` of the store that removes all access to the underlying app state.
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
Write a function that transforms a `Store<GlobalValue, GlobalAction>` into a `Store<GlobalValue, LocalAction>`. That is, a function of the following signature:

```swift
extension Store {
  func view<LocalAction>(
    /* what arguments are needed? */
    ) -> Store<Value, LocalAction> {

    fatalError("Unimplemented")
  }
}
```

What kind of data does the function need to be supplied with in addition to a store? Is this kind of transformation familiar? Does it have a name we've used before on Point-Free?
