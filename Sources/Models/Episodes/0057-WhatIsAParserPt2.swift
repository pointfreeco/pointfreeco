Now that we've looked at a bunch of parsers that are at our disposal, let's ask ourselves what a parser really is from the perspective of functional programming and functions. We'll take a multi-step journey and optimize using Swift language features.

Create a parser `char: Parser<Character>` that will parser a single character off the front of the input string.

Create a parser `whitespace: Parser<Void>` that consumes all of the whitespace from the front of the input string. Note that this parser is of type `Void` because we probably don't care about the actual whitespace we consumed, we just want it consumed.
"""),

Right now our `int` parser doesn't work for negative numbers, for example `int.run("-123")` will fail. Fix this deficiency in `int`.
"""),

Create a parser `double: Parser<Double>` that consumes a double from the front of the input string.

  .init(problem: """
Define a function `literal: (String) -> Parser<Void>` that takes a string, and returns a parser which will parse that string from the beginning of the input. This exercise shows how you can build complex parsers: you can use a function to take some up-front configuration, and then use that data in the definition of the parser.
"""),
  .init(problem: """
In this episode we mentioned that there is a correspondence between functions of the form `(A) -> A` and functions `(inout A) -> Void`. We even covered this in a previous episode, but it is instructive to write it out again. So, define two functions `toInout` and `fromInout` that will transform functions of the form `(A) -> A` to functions `(inout A) -> Void`, and vice-versa.
