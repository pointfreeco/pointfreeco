Even though `map`, `flatMap` and `zip` pack a punch, there are still many parsing operations that can't be done using them alone. This is where "parser combinators" come into play. Let's look at a few common parsing problems and solve them using parser combinators!

We defined `prefix(while:)` to parse off a substring while characters matched a predicate. It can be just as useful to skip characters. Define a `drop(while:)` parser that skips characters that match a given predicate. What type of parser should `drop(while:)` return?

Define a parser combinator, `zeroOrMore`, that takes a parser of `A`s as input and produces a parser of `Array<A>`s by running the existing parser as many times as it can.

Define a parser combinator, `oneOrMore`, that takes a parser of `A`s as input and produces a parser of `Array<A>`s that must include at least one value.

Because `oneOrMore` guarantees at least one value, letâ€™s enforce it in the type system! Update `oneOrMore` to return `Parser<NonEmptyArray<A>>` instead of `Parser<[A]>`.

Enhance the `zeroOrMore` and `oneOrMore` parsers to take a `separatedBy` argument in order to parse a comma-separated list. Ensure that only separators _between_ parsed values are consumed.
