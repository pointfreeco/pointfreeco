This week we explore how functional setters can be used with the types we build and use everyday. It turns out that Swift generates a whole set of functional setters for you to use, but it can be hard to see just how powerful they are without a little help.

In this episode we used `Dictionary`'s subscript key path without explaining it much. For a `key: Key`,
one can construct a key path `\\.[key]` for setting a value associated with `key`. What is the
signature of the setter `prop(\\.[key])`? Explain the difference between this setter and the setter
`prop(\\.[key]) <<< map`, where `map` is the optional map.

The signature of the setter `prop(\\.[key])` is `((Value?) -> Value?) -> [Key: Value] -> [Key: Value]`,
whereas the signature for the mapped version is `((Value) -> Value) -> [Key: Value] -> [Key: Value]`.
The `prop(\\.[key])` version allows you to both set values for nonexistant keys as well as nil out existing keys.

The `Set<A>` type in Swift does not have any key paths that we can use for adding and removing values.
However, that shouldn't stop us from defining a functional setter! Define a function `elem` with
signature `(A) -> ((Bool) -> Bool) -> (Set<A>) -> Set<A>`, which is a functional setter that allows one
to add and remove a value `a: A` to a set by providing a transformation `(Bool) -> Bool`, where the
input determines if the value is already in the set and the output determines if the value should be
included.

Generalizing exercise #1 a bit, it turns out that all subscript methods on a type get a compiler

Recall from a [previous episode](/episodes/ep5-higher-order-functions) that the free `filter` function

composed setter `prop(\\User.favoriteFoods) <<< filter` represent?

`prop(\\User.favoriteFoods) <<< filter` allows you to filter a users favorite foods in-place. For example,

Unfortunately no :( Swift only gives us access to key paths for structs, and provides nothing for enums. Maybe that will change some day!
