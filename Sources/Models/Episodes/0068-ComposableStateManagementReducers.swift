Now that we understand some of the fundamental problems that we will encounter when building a complex application, let's start solving some of them! We will begin by demonstrating a technique for describing the state and actions in your application, as well as a consistent way to apply mutations to your application's state.

In this episode we remarked that there is an equivalence between functions of the form `(A) -> A` and functions `(inout A) -> Void`, which is something we covered in our episode on [side effects](/episodes/ep2-side-effects). Prove this to yourself by implementing the following two functions which demonstrate how to transform from one type of function to the other:

```
func toInout<A>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> A) -> (inout A) -> Void {
  fatalError("Unimplemented")

func fromInout<A>(_ f: @escaping (inout A) -> Void) -> (A) -> A {

Our `appReducer` is starting to get pretty big. Right now we are switching over an enum that has 5 cases, but for a much larger application you may have dozen or even hundreds of cases to consider. This clearly is not going to scale well.

It's possible to break up a reducer into smaller reducers by implementing the following function:

```
func combine<Value, Action>(
  _ first: @escaping (inout Value, Action) -> Void,
  _ second: @escaping (inout Value, Action) -> Void
) -> (inout Value, Action) -> Void {
  fatalError("Unimplemented")

Break up the `appReducer` into 3 reducers: one for the counter view, one for the prime modal, and one for the favorites prime view. Reconstitute the `appReducer` by using the `combine` function on each of the 3 reducers you create.

What do you lose in breaking the reducer up?

You can break `appReducer` down into the following more domain-specific reducers:

```
func counterReducer(value: inout AppState, action: AppAction) -> Void {
  switch action {
  case .counter(.decrTapped):
    state.count -= 1

  case .counter(.incrTapped):
    state.count += 1

  default:
    break

func primeModalReducer(state: inout AppState, action: AppAction) -> Void {
  switch action {
  case .primeModal(.addFavoritePrime):
    state.favoritePrimes.append(state.count)
    state.activityFeed.append(.init(timestamp: Date(), type: .addedFavoritePrime(state.count)))

  case .primeModal(.removeFavoritePrime):
    state.favoritePrimes.removeAll(where: { $0 == state.count })
    state.activityFeed.append(.init(timestamp: Date(), type: .removedFavoritePrime(state.count)))

func favoritePrimesReducer(state: inout AppState, action: AppAction) -> Void {
  switch action {

      state.favoritePrimes.remove(at: index)

    break

Unfortunately, we needed to add `default` cases to each switch statement.

Although it is nice that the previous exercise allowed us to break up the `appReducer` into 3 smaller ones, each of those smaller reducers still operate on the entirety of `AppState`, even if they only want a small piece of sub-state.

Explore ways in which we can transform reducers that work on sub-state into reducers that work on global `AppState`. To get your feet wet, start by trying to implement the following function to lift a reducer on just the `count` field up to global state:

```
func transform(
  _ localReducer: @escaping (inout Int, AppAction) -> Void
) -> (inout AppState, AppAction) -> Void {
  fatalError("Unimplemented")
}

Can you generalize the solution to the previous exercise to work for any generic `LocalValue` and `GlobalValue` instead of being specific to `Int` and `AppState`? And can you generalize the action to a single shared `Action` among global and local state?

Hint: this solution requires you to both extract a local value from a global one to send it through the reducer, and take the updated local value and set it on the global one. Swift provides an excellent way of handling this: writable key paths!
