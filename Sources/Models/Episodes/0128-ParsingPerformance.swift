          While researching the string APIs for this episode we stumbled upon a massive inefficiency in how Swift implements `removeFirst` on certain collections. This PR fixes the problem and turns the method from an `O(n)` operation (where `n` is the length of the array) to an `O(k)` operation (where `k` is the number of elements being removed).

      While string's `UTF8View` offers a super-performant, low-level abstraction, we have found that there are other low-level abstractions that offer different performance characteristics. For one, while `UTF8View` is a Swift `Collection` of `UInt8`s, so is a more general array `[UInt8]`. Write another `int` parser overload where `Input` is a more general array. What changes in the implementation? What changes as far as performance is concerned?
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      For our parser type to work most efficiently, we will constrain our parser to work with `ArraySlice`, which has a subsequence of the same type and can share storage when removing elements from the start and end of the array by simply moving the indices:

      ```swift
      extension Parser where Input == ArraySlice<UInt8>, Output == Int {
        static let int = Self { input in
          var isFirstCharacter = true
          let intPrefix = input.prefix { c in
            defer { isFirstCharacter = false }
            return (c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "-") || c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "+")) && isFirstCharacter
              || (UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "0")...UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "9")).contains(c)
          }

          guard let match = Int(String(decoding: intPrefix, as: UTF8.self))
          else { return nil }

          input.removeFirst(intPrefix.count)
          return match
        }
      }
      ```

      The only two changes are in the constraint, which is `ArraySlice<UInt8>` instead of `Substring.UTF8View`, and where the match is converted to a string, which must now use the more generalized `String.init(decoding:as:)` initializer instead of the `String.init`-`Substring.init` that was possible given a `Substring.UTF8View`.

      As far as performance is concerned, there are two things to consider. We must first convert a string to an array before we can parse it, which is a performance cost that both requires double the memory, and the up-front cost of that conversion. Once the string it converted, however, it appears to be about 30â€“40% faster to parse.
      """#
  ),
  .init(
    problem: #"""
      There is another abstraction level we can parse from, and that's unsafe pointers (ðŸ˜°), but we don't necessarily have to fear them!

      Write another `int` parser that works on an input for one of the safer of unsafe pointers: `UnsafeBufferPointer`. This is a pointer to a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory. Strings offer two main ways of accessing this kind of data:

      ```swift
      // Directly on the string:
      string.withUTF8 { (ptr: UnsafeBufferPointer<UInt8>) in
        ...
      }

      // On any collection:
      string.utf8.withContiguousStorageIfAvailable { (ptr: UnsafeBufferPointer<UInt8>) in
        ...
      }
      ```

      After writing this parser, benchmark it against each interface.
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      Starting from the previous exercise, the only thing that needs to change is the extension, which needs to work on a _slice_ of a buffer pointer. Everything else is the same:

      ```swift
      extension Parser where Input == Slice<UnsafeBufferPointer<UInt8>>, Output == Int {
        static let int = Self { input in
          var isFirstCharacter = true
          let intPrefix = input.prefix { c in
            defer { isFirstCharacter = false }
            return (c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "-") || c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "+")) && isFirstCharacter
              || (UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "0")...UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "9")).contains(c)
          }

          guard let match = Int(String(decoding: intPrefix, as: UTF8.self))
          else { return nil }

          input.removeFirst(intPrefix.count)
          return match
        }
      }
      ```

      We can benchmark `withUTF8` and `withContiguousStorageIfAvailable` with a little extra upfront work.

      `withUTF8` requires a mutable string (or substring), since if the string is _not_ in contiguous memory, it must be moved into contiguous memory beforehand, so we must copy the string into a mutable variable before parsing. The operation returns a non-failable result because strings can always move their bytes into contiguous memory.

      ```swift
      suite.benchmark("withUTF8") {
        var s = string
        precondition(
          s.withUTF8 { ptr in
            var ptr = ptr[...]
            return Parser.int.run(&ptr)!
          }
          == 1234567890
        )
      }
      ```

      `withContiguousStorageIfAvailable` on the other hand is more general and more failable. If contiguous memory cannot be allocated for the given collection, it will return `nil`, so we must further unwrap it in our precondition (we know it should never fail for `UTF8View`s).

      ```swift
      suite.benchmark("withContiguousStorageIfAvailable") {
        precondition(
          string.utf8.withContiguousStorageIfAvailable { ptr in
            var ptr = ptr[...]
            return Parser.int.run(&ptr)!
          }!
          == 1234567890)
        )
      }
      ```

      Performance-wise, these methods are even faster than `ArraySlice<UInt8>` and do not incur the same memory cost: about 2x faster than `UTF8View` and 70% faster than `ArraySlice<UInt8>`. Performance between each interface is negligible and can be measured in under 10 nanoseconds.
      """#
  ),
  .init(
    problem: #"""
      The `int` parser on `UTF8View`, `[UInt8]` and `UnsafeBufferPointer<UInt8>` can be unified in a single implementation that is constrained against the `Collection` protocol. Comment out the other parsers and use this single, more generalized parser, instead. How does this affect performance?
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      The body of this parser is the same as the last two. We just need to update the extension with more general constraints and use a computed static property instead of a `let`:

      ```swift
      extension Parser
      where
        Input: Collection,
        Input.SubSequence == Input,
        Input.Element == UInt8,
        Output == Int
      {
        static var int: Self {
          Self { input in
            var isFirstCharacter = true
            let intPrefix = input.prefix { c in
              defer { isFirstCharacter = false }
              return (c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "-") || c == UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "+")) && isFirstCharacter
                || (UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "0")...UTF8.CodeUnit(ascii: "9")).contains(c)
            }

            guard let match = Int(String(decoding: intPrefix, as: UTF8.self))
            else { return nil }

            input.removeFirst(intPrefix.count)
            return match
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      Performance characteristics seem to be the same (in this single module).
