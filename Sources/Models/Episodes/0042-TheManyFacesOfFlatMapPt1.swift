Previously we've discussed the `map` and `zip` operations in detail, and today we start completing the trilogy by exploring `flatMap`. This operation is precisely the tool needed to solve a nesting problem that `map` and `zip` alone cannot.

Up until Swift 4.1 there was an additional `flatMap` on sequences that we did not consider in this episode, but that's because it doesn't act quite like the normal `flatMap`. Swift ended up deprecating the overload, and we discuss why this happened in a previous episode:
