      SwiftUI has introduced the concept of “████ed views”, which gives you a really nice way to ████ the text and images from views. This is really powerful, but just because the view has been ████ed it doesn't mean the logic has also been ████ed. We show why this is problematic and why we want to fix it.

      Today we are going to look at a brand new feature of SwiftUI and show how the Composable Architecture can enhance it. This is a little different from some of our other series of episodes where we dive into general principles that are broadly applicable. Instead we are going to focus on something very specific, but along the way some really cool things that we never even considered when we first began working on the architecture.

      We are going to discuss what the Composable Architecture has to say about a brand new feature of iOS 14 and SwiftUI. [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) is a library we built up from first principles in episodes over the past year, and then 4 months ago we finally open sourced it. We haven’t really talked much about the architecture since open sourcing, but then something happened recently that we just had to discuss.

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
      In a recent beta release we were all given access to a brand new API that allows you to redact an entire view, so that text views are blocked out by grey boxes, and even images are blocked out. It’s pretty amazing to see, and the power of SwiftUI is really starting to show that things that were previously hard to even imagine are now possible.
      """#,
    timestamp: (0 * 60 + 55),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      And there are lots of applications of this trick. We can use it while loading data so that we can show the user what the UI will look like once everything finishes, and while they wait they can just see an outline of shapes. It can also be interesting to use this trick to focus the user’s attention on a particular part of the screen. You could imagine an onboarding experience that redacts everything on the screen except one small part so that you can teach the person how to use that part of your application.
      """#,
    timestamp: (1 * 60 + 25),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
      Now, although this is a cool trick, if you use it naively you will have some really weird UI experiences. Just because the visual UI is redacted doesn’t mean that the logic of the view is redacted. For example, it’s possible for the UI to be redacted but for all of your buttons, UI controls, and gestures to be active, which means the user can still do things with it even though maybe they shouldn’t.

      And so what we want to show is that features built with the Composable Architecture can take advantage of this new redaction feature in a really unique way, and replicating this technique in vanilla SwiftUI is quite difficult, if not impossible. We will show that you can selectively disable all of the logic for a particular part of your application, and that opens up all types of cool possibilities.

      This makes it seem as if we creating the `ArticleRowView` from just a static piece of data, but secretly in that view we are actually instantiating a whole new view model:

      This `@StateObject` property wrapper is new, and it allows us to create a view model from within a view. That may not seem like anything special, but recall that SwiftUI recreates these little view structs many many times. It could do it dozens or hundreds of times. And that’s supposed to be ok because these structs don’t represent actual UI, but rather a description of UI that will later be rendered. That’s the real power of SwiftUI, the fact that it has such a lightweight description of view hierarchies.

      But if we are recreating this row potentially dozens, or hundreds, of times, doesn’t that mean we’ll also create the view model many times? Well, that’s where the `@StateObject` comes into play. It will guarantee that the view model is only created a single time for this view. This is very similar to how `@State` works, because if we did something like:
      """#,
    timestamp: (7 * 60 + 25),

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      Then this value is initialized and set to 1 only the first time the view is created. Subsequent creations of this view will share whatever value the previous views had.

    timestamp: (7 * 60 + 48),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
      We can even see how invoking `StateObject` initializer does not necessarily execute the code creating the view model we pass to it, because secretly it takes an autoclosure under the hood:
      """#,
    timestamp: (8 * 60 + 1),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
      @propertyWrapper

      Now its worth saying that there’s actually quite a bit conflicting information out there on whether or not this is a correct way of initializing a `StateObject`.

We have some references on the episode page to help you research this a bit yourself, and we will have some episodes in the future that goes deep into this topic.

      One thing you’ll notice is that we do properly handle the logic for hiding the article in the view model, yet when we tap the button the article does not hide. This is because we are updating the state as far as the `ArticleViewModel` is concerned, but it’s the `ArticlesViewModel` that drives the list of articles. And that state is not being updated. We need some way to have this child view model communicate to the parent. This is the problem that we alluded to a moment ago. It is possible to fix this situation, but we plan on discussing this topic in some dedicated episodes in the future, so we won’t dive any further into it.

      The main reason to create custom reasons is if you have logic inside your views that should change based on the type of reason being used. For example, you can use the reason to render the redaction differently, like using a blur instead of a solid grey rectangle.

    timestamp: (13 * 60 + 9),

      For example, while articles are loading I can tap on one of the placeholder articles and it brings up a sheet. That’s not ideal at all.

      So let’s fix this. SwiftUI gives us a tool to help our views know when they are redacted. We can add an environment variable to our view, which holds the current set of reasons, if any, of why the view is being redacted:
      """#,
    timestamp: (17 * 60 + 31),

      """#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      And then we can inspect this value whenever the user does something in the UI, and if it contains any reasons we can short circuit that logic so that it is never executed:

    timestamp: (18 * 60 + 1),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      So that takes care of the icon buttons in the article row, but we also have the button for the whole article row itself. And that needs to be done in the `ArticlesView`. In this view we don’t have any redaction reasons, so we don’t need to introduce an environment value. Instead we can just access the `viewStore`'s `isLoading` boolean just like we’ve done before:
      """#,
    timestamp: (18 * 60 + 25),

      """#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)

      And now the view is a bit friendlier to use. We are free to tap around while it’s loading without fear of executing some business logic or firing off API requests.

      But this isn’t how we would want to craft our code in a real application. We have now littered random bits of logic all over our views to check for this `redactionReasons` value, which has complicated the essence of what this view is responsible for. Also, as we add more features to this application we will have to always remember to redact its logic or we run the risk of accidentally executing logic when placeholders are visible. And this is definitely a real problem to worry about because 6 months from now you may not remember all the ins and outs of how loading placeholders work, or perhaps one of your colleagues will want to make changes to this view, and as it stands right now its a bit of a mine field of potential gotchas.

      - Disabling the list means that all the colors have gotten lighter. The grays are lighter, and even the icons are lighter. Maybe this isn’t a big deal to you, but it will be the reality of using this technique: all of the UI will get dimmer and less vibrant.

      - Disabling has also changed the semantic meaning of this view. It’s not really that this view is disabled, it’s just that we want to put in a static, inert version of the UI.

      - Disabling may not disable everything you expect it to. It certainly disables things like buttons, text fields and other UI controls, but other events will still fire.

      - Also, once you disable a view hierarchy there is no way to selectively re-enable parts of the inside of the view. This is possible with redactions. We haven’t covered it yet, but soon we will see that within a redacted view we can unredact certain parts to make it visible to the user again. This impedance mismatch between these two APIs is really pointing at the fact that disabling UI is not a great way for handling this functionality. There may be times that we want to unredact a little bit of the view, and inside that view we have a button. We will have no way of re-enabling it and so it will stay stuck as disabled. And what if that button did something important, like canceled the inflight request? It’s definitely not acceptable to just blanket disable everything.

      The main reason this is happening is that our view is inextricably linked with its logic.

      We feel that although SwiftUI views are an amazing technology, they are ripe for abuse in this regard. There is a phrase that people in the programming community that is very popular and seen as a kind of "north star" for software development, and it says that we should try to “separate concerns” in our applications. Now of course there is no precise definition of what “separate” and “concerns” means. Does separate mean put code in separate files, or does it mean something deeper? And can an entire screen be one concern, or must it be composed of many concerns, and how granular should we get? For this reason we think the “separation of concerns” adage is a very broad guideline, and not something that can be rigorously applied.
