We talk about dependencies a lot on Point-Free, but we've never done a deep dive on how to tune them for testing. It's time to do just that, by first showing how a test can exhaustively describe its dependencies, which comes with some incredible benefits.

Define an assertion helper that asserts against the events that buffer into the `events` array _and_ clear them out to prepare for the next assertion.

Bonus points if you make it generic over any collection of equatable elements so that it can be extracted into a reusable library!
"""#,
    solution: #"""
Because `events` has been extracted to a test case property, the simplest solution can be defined as a helper method:

```swift
class TodosTests: XCTestCase {
  ...

  func assertTracked(events: [AnalyticsClient.Event]) {
    XCTAssertEqual(events, self.events)
    self.events.removeAll()
  }
}
```
