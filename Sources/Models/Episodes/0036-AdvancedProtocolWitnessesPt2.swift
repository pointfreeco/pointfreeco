We complete our dictionary for translating Swift protocol concepts into concrete datatypes and functions. This includes protocol inheritance, protocol extensions, default implementations _and_ protocols with associated types. Along the way we will also show how concrete types can express things that are currently impossible with Swift protocols.

Currently Swift does not allow protocol methods to contain arguments with default values. For example, the following protocol is not representable in Swift:

```swift
protocol Service {
  func fetchUser(id: Int, cache: Bool = false) -> User?
}

// ðŸ›‘ Default argument not permitted in a protocol method
```

Show how this can be done with a concrete data type representation of `Service`.
"""),
.init(problem: """
Currently Swift does not allow protocols to extend other protocols, even if you provide all of the extensions requirements. For example, we cannot extend `Numeric` to be combinable even though it is easy to implement the requirement:

```swift
extension Numeric: Combinable {
  func combine(with other: Self) -> Self {
    return self + other
  }
}

// ðŸ›‘ Extension of protocol 'Numeric' cannot have an inheritance clause
```
