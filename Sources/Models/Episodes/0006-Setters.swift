The programs we write can be reduced to transforming data from one form into another. We’re used to transforming this data imperatively, with setters. There’s a strange world of composition hiding here in plain sight, and it has a surprising link to a familiar functional friend.

As we saw with free `map` on `Array`, define free `map` on `Optional` and use it to compose setters
that traverse into an optional field.

Take a `struct`, _e.g._:

```
struct User {
  let name: String
}

Write a setter for its property. Take (or add) another property, and add a setter for it. What are
some potential issues with building these setters?

Take a `struct` with a nested `struct`, _e.g._:

```
struct Location {

Write a setter for `userLocationName`. Now write setters for `userLocation` and `locationName`. How do
these setters compose?
