It's time to fully modularize our app! Our views can still send any app action, so let's explore transforming stores to focus in on just the local actions a view cares about.

  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
It can be useful to produce "read-only" stores that cannot send any actions. Write a `view` that transforms a store that can perform actions into a store that cannot perform actions. What is the appropriate data type to describe the `Action` of such a store?

In our second episode on [algebraic data types](/episodes/ep9-algebraic-data-types-exponents), we explored such a transformation.
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
In our first episode on [algebraic data types](/episodes/ep4-algebraic-data-types), we introduced the `Either` type, which is the most generic, non-trivial enum one could make:

```swift
enum Either<A, B> {
  case left(A)
  case right(B)
}
```

In this episode we create a wrapper enum called `CounterViewAction` to limit the counter view's ability to send any app action. Instead of introducing an ad hoc enum, refactor things to utilize the `Either` type.

How does this compare to utilizing structs and tuples for intermediate state?
