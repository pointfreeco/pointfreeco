      Use `withTaskCancellationHandler` to allow the async version of `ViewStore.send(_:while:)` to be cancelled. Ensure that the task can be cancelled _before_ the publisher assigns the cancellable.
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      Introducing `withTaskCancellationHandler` and invoking the cancellable's `cancel` method in the handler will allow the handler to cancel the underlying Combine publisher. To handle cancellation that occurs before the operation is invoked, we can call `Task.checkCancellation()` at the beginning of the operation, and again in the continuation. Because continuation closures are not throwing, we must handle cancellation through the continuation's `resume(throwing:)` method instead.

      ```swift
      extension ViewStore {
        func send(
          _ action: Action,
          `while` isInFlight: @escaping (State) -> Bool
        ) async {
          self.send(action)

          var cancellable: Cancellable?
          try? await withTaskCancellationHandler(
            handler: { [cancellable] in cancellable?.cancel() },

      Introduce a `ViewStore.send(_:animation:while:)` overload with the following signature:

      ```swift
      extension ViewStore {
        func send(
          _ action: Action,
          animation: Animation?,
          while predicate: @escaping (State) -> Bool
        ) async {
          fatalError("unimplemented")
        }
      }
      ```

      Where `animation` animates the synchronous mutation to state caused by `action`.

      Is it possible to implement in terms of `ViewStore.send(_:while:)`? If not, why not, and what are some ways of sharing the original implementation?
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      At this time, it does not appear to be possible to implement this overload in terms of the original, because the mutation happens in the asynchronous context of the upstream `ViewStore.send(_:while:)`, and `withAnimation` can not capture asynchronous work.

      We can instead generalize with another helper that simply suspends a view store till some state holds true:

      ```swift
      extension ViewStore {
        func suspend(while predicate: @escaping (State) -> Bool) async {
          var cancellable: Cancellable?
          try? await withTaskCancellationHandler(
            handler: { [cancellable] in cancellable?.cancel() },
            operation: {
              try Task.checkCancellation()
              try await withUnsafeThrowingContinuation { (continuation: UnsafeContinuation<Void, Error>) in
                guard !Task.isCancelled else {
                  continuation.resume(throwing: CancellationError())
                  return
                }
                cancellable = self.publisher
                  .filter { !predicate($0) }
                  .prefix(1)
                  .sink { _ in
                    continuation.resume()
                    _ = cancellable
                  }
              }
            }
          )
        }
      }
      ```

      And then, both `send` helpers can utilize this shared code:

      ```swift
      extension ViewStore {
        func send(
          _ action: Action,
          while predicate: @escaping (State) -> Bool
        ) async {
          self.send(action)
          await self.suspend(while: predicate)
        }

        func send(
          _ action: Action,
          animation: Animation?,
          while predicate: @escaping (State) -> Bool
        ) async {
          withAnimation(animation) { self.send(action) }
          await self.suspend(while: predicate)
        }
      }

      The `ViewStore.publisher` property is a handy way of getting a publisher of state to use in Combine. Let's define another property that bridges things to Swift's new concurrency APIs, specifically `AsyncSequence`, by implementing the following:

        So, that’s a quick introduction to the new `.refreshable` view modifier in SwiftUI, along with a small dose of `async`/`await`. There’s still so much more to say Swift’s concurrency model, but we’re glad that the new `.refreshable` API gave us an excuse to dive in some of the more advanced topics, such as tasks, cancellation and testing.

        Now let’s see what all of this looks like in the Composable Architecture. We’re going to rebuild this feature using our library, and we’ll see that we can still leverage the `.refreshable` view modifier even though the Composable Architecture has no direct support for `async`/`await`. Even better, we can support this `.refreshable` API without making any changes whatsoever to the core library.

        However, in the Composable Architecture there is another set of actions that are explicitly modeled that we don’t have to think about when building an observable object in vanilla SwiftUI, and that’s actions that are emitted by effects.

        Right now we only have a single effect that needs to be tied to an action, and that is when we execute the fact API request, it wants to feed its data back into the system. We can model this with a single case that holds a result type that contains a fact or an error:

        Next we model the environment of dependencies that this feature needs to do its job. At a bare minimum we need some kind of client for making the API request for the number fact.

        We can use this bridge to create an awaitable task that suspends until the Combine publisher we constructed emits.

        Now when we run the preview we can see that cancellation works as expected. The interaction is a bit harsher than it is in vanilla SwiftUI, which animates these actions.

        So this is pretty awesome. We were able to support a fancy new async/await feature in the Composable Architecture without overhauling the entire library to use async/await and without even needing access to the internals of the library. This new async `.send` method could have just as easily be written by anyone without waiting for us to bring this feature to the library.

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        - First, with the Composable Architecture we do have to manage state a little more than we did in the vanilla SwiftUI version. With the observable object we got a 1-to-1 correspondence between the work being executed for refreshing and the `isLoading` boolean. In the Composable Architecture we have to manage that state ourselves.

            However, even in the vanilla SwiftUI version there is a little bit of state management you have to keep up with. You have to remember to mark the handle variable as `@Published` so its changes trigger SwiftUI view updates, and you have to remember to `nil` out that state in order to clean things up when work is completed or cancelled.

        - Second, our new async `.send` method isn’t fully correct just yet. There is a possibility that SwiftUI may want to cancel the work happening inside the closure handed to the `.refreshable` method. We’re not aware of any concrete examples of this, but ostensibly it’s possible. So, we need to do a little bit of extra work to tap into that moment of cancellation, which we can do with something known as `withTaskCancellationHandler`, but we will leave that as an exercise for the viewer, which you can find at the bottom of the episode page.

        OK, so we’ve accomplished what we set out to do, but let’s do one more thing. Let’s write some tests! Perhaps the most important feature of the Composable Architecture is its comprehensive testing tools. We want absolutely everything to be testable in the architecture, from the execution of effects and how they feed data back into the system to the glue code that combines lots of disparate features into one big feature. We want it all to be capable of being tested, and done so in a simple, ergonomic way.

        We can start the test by constructing a `TestStore`, which gives us a runtime that tracks how actions are fed into the system and how the state changes over time, and forces us to assert on every little thing that takes place on the inside. In order to construct the test store we have to provide the environment of dependencies, and we can provide dependencies that perform their work immediately and synchronously:

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        Now we can start sending actions to the test store, like say emulating the action of the user tapping the increment button:

        That leads to a test failure because along with every action sent to the store we have to assert on exactly how the state changed. To do that we open up a trailing closure on the `.send` method and mutate `$0` to describe exactly how state changed:

        Let’s test something a little more complicated. Let’s emulate what happens when the user pulls the list down to refresh the fact. We know that the `isLoading` state should flip to `true`, so we can describe that state change:

      timestamp: (26 * 60 + 36),

        But running tests results in another test failure. This time the library is telling us that an effect executed and caused an action to be fed back into the system, and we haven’t yet asserted on that.

        However, with the Composable Architecture we can easily tap into every little moment before and after effects are executed and can assert on how the state changes in those subtle flows. We also are forced to exhaustively assert on how every little piece of state changed. If we forget something, or if new fields are added to state later we will instantly be notified with a test failure. For example, suppose we forgot to flip `isLoading` back to `true` in the test when we receive the fact response:

        Let’s push things a little further by testing the flow where the user cancels the inflight fact request. Recall that we couldn’t figure out how to test that flow in the vanilla SwiftUI version.

        Either way, testing this flow in the Composable Architecture is a breeze. In order to get access to the brief moment that exists between refreshing and receiving a fact response, we need to use a different kind of scheduler for the main queue. For the test we just wrote we used an immediate scheduler because we didn’t need access to those moments and so it was ok to squash all of time into a single moment and force our effects to produce a value immediately.

This not only includes state changes and receiving data from effects as we have seen before, but also forces that every effect be completed by the time the test is finished. If the fact effect was still in flight by the time the test finished executing then we would have gotten a failure. The mere fact this test passes proves that it's impossible for any effects to later feed data back into the system.

If you are using a test scheduler, advance the scheduler so that the effects may complete, or consider using an immediate scheduler to immediately perform the effect instead.
        >
        > • If you are returning a long-living effect (timers, notifications, subjects, etc.), then make sure those effects are torn down by marking the effect ".cancellable" and returning a corresponding cancellation effect ("Effect.cancel") from another action, or, if your effect is driven by a Combine subject, send it a completion.

        The test now fails because it has detected that there is an effect in flight.

        If the library did not fail on this situation then it would mean you could have effects still executing when the test finished, which means there’s the potential for new actions to be fed into the system and change state, all without you making any assertions. That can either hide actual bugs or hide new logic that should be tested, but if the test didn’t loudly complain you may forget to add test coverage.

        One thing we can do to make the test complete is advance the scheduler a tick, causing the effect to emit and feed its data back into the system:

        But now we get a different error, similar to one we saw before, where an action was fed into the system but we didn’t explicitly assert on it by calling the `.receive` method.

        So, this is showing what it means for the Composable Architecture to be exhaustive in testing. You really do need to describe everything that is happening in the system, from state mutations to effect executions. Let’s get back into a passing state by bringing back the `.cancelButtonTapped` action:
        """#,
      timestamp: (33 * 60 + 8),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        store.send(.refresh) {

        Now the test passes, and so this really is proving that the fact effect cancellation works as we expect.

        This is great. We are able to hook into a brand new SwiftUI feature in the Composable Architecture with very little work. It even uses `async`/`await`, which the Composable Architecture doesn’t even have official support for (yet), but we were still able to build the tools necessary for bridging these worlds. Even better, we were able to accomplish all of this without making a single change to the internals of the library, which means all of our viewers could have introduced this to their code bases without waiting for us.

        It’s also pretty cool how easy it was to test everything we did, but to be fair we also think that someday Swift’s standard library will have more tools for us to better test asynchronous code, probably via executors.

        Next week we will discuss another new, fancy feature announced at WWDC: focus state. Like `.refreshable` it isn’t exactly clear how it adapts to the Composable Architecture, but it’s totally possible and it exploring that even shows how to work with focus state in observable objects too.
