So what is the point of parser builders anyway? We will leverage our new builder syntax by rewriting a couple more complex parsers: a marathon parser and a URL router. This will lead us to not only clean up noise and tell a more concise parsing story, but give us a chance to create brand new parsing tools.

> Parsing is a surprisingly ubiquitous problem in programming. Every time we construct an integer or a URL from a string, we are technically doing parsing. After demonstrating the many types of parsing that Apple gives us access to, we will take a step back and define the essence of parsing in a single type. That type supports many wonderful types of compositions, and allows us to break large, complex parsing problems into small, understandable units.
