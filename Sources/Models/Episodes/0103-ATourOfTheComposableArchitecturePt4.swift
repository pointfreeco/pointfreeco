We get two failures in this test. One is telling us that there is still an effect inflight that has not yet completed. This is an extremely important error to have because it is forcing us to exhaustively prove that we handled all of the effects in the system. Without this failure we could be firing off effects that later change our system‚Äôs state and we wouldn‚Äôt be getting any test coverage on that.
"""#,

The other failure is telling us that the changes we made to the state in the assertion does not match what actually happened.

And this is because the sort hasn‚Äôt happened yet, it happens after a delay of 1 second.
"""#,
    timestamp: (1*60 + 9),

The second failure is the easiest to fix, because after the `checkboxTapped` action is sent the only thing that changes in the state is that the first item‚Äôs `isComplete` flag flips to `true`:

The effect that is inflight is the delayed effect which will deliver the `todoDelayCompleted` action once a second passes. The only way to make that happen is to literally have the test suite wait for a second. The `assert` method supports inserting little imperative tasks like that in between steps, and it‚Äôs called a `do` block:
"""#,
    timestamp: (1*60 + 56),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(

store.assert(

)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
This `do` block will be executed before going onto the next step, and so in here we can wait for a second. The way to do this is using `self.expectation`s:
"""#,
    timestamp: (2*60 + 24),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
store.assert(

  }
)
"""#,
    timestamp: nil,

It‚Äôs a bit messy, but gets the job done.

Now if we run tests we get a new failure:

This is telling us that the system received an action from an effect, but we didn‚Äôt properly account for it in our assertion. And indeed, after the 1 second passed the `.todoDelayCompleted` was finally delivered. And again, this is a really powerful. It is forcing us to consider everything that is happening in the system. We can‚Äôt just allow effects to run and deliver their payloads back to the system without us explicitly declaring that happened. In the future this can even catch when accidental new effects creep into the system that we did not expect. So it‚Äôs very important for us to be getting these kinds of exhaustive checks in our test.
"""#,
    timestamp: (3*60 + 16),

So, to prove that we expected to receive this action we need to add an additional step to our assertion:

The first failure is saying that we must account for all of the actions received from effects before we are allowed to send new actions.

Before moving on we want to mention one more tiny simplification we can make. The combination of delaying an effect and cancelling inflight effects when starting a new one has a name that is well-known in the reactive programming communities: it‚Äôs called debounce. Probably the most prototypical example of this operation is when a user types into a search field. We may naively want to execute an API request with each key stroke, but that would both flood our API with many more requests than are necessary, and the responses from those requests may come back in unpredictable order. A better approach would be to debounce the key stroke events so that we only execute an API request if the user stops typing for a brief moment.
"""#,
    timestamp: (7*60 + 17),
    type: .paragraph
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
The Composable Architecture comes with a debounce operator on effects specifically for this kind of functionality:

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
return Effect(value: .todoDelayCompleted)

    timestamp: nil,
    type: .code(lang: .swift)
  ),
  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
And everything will still work the same, and even better all of our tests will pass. We wrote some intricate tests around how the timing and cancellation worked, and the fact that those tests are still passing even though we changed the operators gives us some confidence that we didn‚Äôt break anything.
"""#,
    timestamp: (8*60 + 37),
    type: .paragraph

  Episode.TranscriptBlock(
    content: #"""
We must warn that Combine also defines a `debounce` operator on the `Publisher` protocol that does _not_ take a cancellation id:

However, this does not give us the behavior we want.

That means 99.5% of the test suite time is spent waiting. Worse, if we have dozens or hundreds of these tests that time could easily add up to minutes of wasted time.

And even if you are ok with waiting a bit of extra time for your tests to run, there is another reason why it‚Äôs not great to write tests like this: it completely destroys debuggability. Say you have a weird failing test that you are trying to debug. If you put a breakpoint somewhere in the code to debug, then when the code stops at that breakpoint the passage of time does not also stop. By the time you continue code execution, many seconds will have passed and you may have missed the window to understand what the heck happened in your code. However, if you control time with a scheduler you get to slowly move time forward while you debug in order to understand what exactly is happening.

Notice that we are using `DispatchQueue.main` as a scheduler. This is another one of those sneaky dependencies, much like the `UUID`  initializer.

The `for` duration has to conform to a whole bunch of protocols, and the scheduler is of type `Scheduler`. `Scheduler` is a protocol in the Combine framework, and it represents a type that can describe when and how to execute a closure.

At this point you may be asking why would we ever use this since this is already more verbose than what we could do with `DispatchQueue` directly. Well, firstly the scheduler abstraction provides more utility than just scheduling a single unit of work. You can also schedule work to be done repeatedly on an interval:

And the reason this abstraction is powerful is that it consolidates a bunch of different ways of scheduling work, such as run loops. We can basically copy and paste the above code but replace dispatch queues with run loops:

And the `Scheduler` protocol is the way Combine abstracts away the responsibility of when and how to execute a unit of work. Any Combine operator that involves time or threading takes a scheduler as an argument, including delaying, throttling, timeouts, debouncing, and more:

So, that‚Äôs what schedulers give us, but what they don‚Äôt give us is a way to control these things during tests. Anytime we use a `DispatchQueue`, `RunLoop` or `OperationQueue` we are hopelessly in the realm of the real world, with all of its complexities and vagaries, and we have no way to control the scheduler except for literally waiting for time to pass.

In the third test we were making sure that effects were actually debounced by cancelling a currently inflight effect. To do that we tapped the checkbox, waited half a second, and then tapped the checkbox again, and then waited another second.

Well, instead of literally waiting we can just advance the scheduler:

store.assert(
  .send(.todo(index: 0, action: .checkboxTapped)) {

    self.scheduler.advance(by: 0.5)

  .send(.todo(index: 0, action: .checkboxTapped)) {

And now when we run tests they all still pass, but it takes only a fraction of a second to complete:

> Executed 3 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.007 (0.026) seconds

Remember that previously when we were doing actual waiting the test suite took over 3.5 seconds to run because we were waiting in real time. Now the tests are over 600 times faster. And if we needed to test an effect that wanted to wait an hour before executing we could simply advance the scheduler forward 3,600 seconds and be done with it.

So, that‚Äôs the Composable Architecture in a nutshell. We covered a ton of material in the past few episodes, including breaking down a complex feature into smaller parts, in particular using the `forEach` operator on reducers, using the environment to control dependencies to the outside work, using effects to communicate with the outside world, and then bringing it all together to write extensive tests of our feature.

But, would you believe there is even more? There is so much packed into the Composable Architecture repo, and so we‚Äôd love if everyone [checked it out](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). There are even more tools for breaking down complex applications into smaller, more understandable units, and there are even more fancy effects tricks.

It‚Äôs right about now on Point-Free that we like to ask ourselves the all important question: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù, because usually we are talking about abstract things and we like to take a moment to bring things back down to earth and show why it‚Äôs worth knowing these things. But this time there‚Äôs really no need. We have shown how quickly we can build a demo application using the Composable Architecture, and showed that we could even start to layer on some pretty complex logic, all the while not sacrificing testability. In fact, testing remained easy, succinct and ergonomic the whole time.

There is still a ton more we could cover about the Composable Architecture, but we‚Äôre going to end the episode here, and next time we will cover some topics that not about architecture. It‚Äôs been awhile since we‚Äôve covered topics not related to the Composable Architecture, and we‚Äôre really excited about it.
