We've all but completely recovered the ergonomics of `Gen` from before we controlled it, but our public `run` function requires an explicit `RandomNumberGenerator` is passed in as a dependency. Add an overload to recover the ergonomics of calling `gen.run()` without a `RandomNumberGenerator`.
""",
    solution: """
The problem here is a bare `run` function collides with the `run` property. This isn't a big blocker, though, because the property is a private concern. We can rename it to anything, like `_run` or `gen` and recover a really nice public interface.

```
struct Gen<A> {
  let gen: (inout AnyRandomNumberGenerator) -> A

  func run<RNG: RandomNumberGenerator>(using rng: inout RNG) -> A {
    var arng = AnyRandomNumberGenerator(rng: rng)
    let result = self.run(&rng)
    rng = arng.rng as! RNG
    return result
  }

  func run() -> A {
    var srng = SystemRandomNumberGenerator()
    return self.run(using: &srng)
  }

Recover `Gen` as a specification of `State` using a type alias.

Generic type aliases allow us to fix any generic, so we can set `S` to `AnyRandomNumberGenerator`.

    problem: """
Deriving `Gen` as a type alias of `State` breaks a bunch of implementations, including:

- `map`
- `flatMap`
- `int(in:)`
- `float(in:)`
- `bool`

Update each implementation for `State`.
""",
    solution: """
We're currently defining `map` by extending `Gen` and working with the `Gen` type internally, which fixes the `S` parameter of `State` to `AnyRandomNumberGenerator`. Let's redefine things without any mention of `Gen`.

```
extension State {
  func map<B>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> B) -> State<S, B> {
    return State<S, B> { s in f(self.run(&s)) }
  }
}
```

And `flatMap` can be updated similarly.

```
extension State {
  func flatMap<B>(_ f: @escaping (A) -> State<S, B>) -> State<S, B> {
    return State<S, B> { s in
      f(self.run(&s)).run(&s)
    }
  }
}
```

Our static helpers on `Gen` need to give the type system a bit more information to behave. Unfortunately `extension Gen` is not the same as `extension State where S == AnyRandomNumberGenerator`, so we need to manually constrain things to have things behave nicely. It helps to define these extensions without mentioning `Gen`.

```
extension State where S == AnyRandomNumberGenerator, A: FixedWidthInteger {
  static func int(in range: ClosedRange<A>) -> State {
    return State { rng in .random(in: range, using: &rng) }
  }
}

extension State where S == AnyRandomNumberGenerator, A: BinaryFloatingPoint, A.RawSignificand: FixedWidthInteger {
  static func int(in range: ClosedRange<A>) -> State {
    return State { rng in .random(in: range, using: &rng) }
  }
}

extension State where S == AnyRandomNumberGenerator, A == Bool {
  static let bool = State { rng in .random(using: &rng) }
  }
}
```
