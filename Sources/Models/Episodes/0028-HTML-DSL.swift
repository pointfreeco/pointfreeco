This week we apply domain-specific languages to a very real-world problem: representing and rendering HTML. We code up a simple but powerful solution that forms the foundation of what we use to build the Point-Free website.

Our `render` function currently prints an extra space when attributes aren't present: `"<header ></header>"`. Fix the `render` function so that `render(header([])) == "<header></header>"`.

HTML specifies a number of "[void elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#void-elements)" (elements that have no closing tag). This includes the `img` element in our example. Update the `render` function to omit the closing tag on void elements.

Our `render` function is currently unsafe: text node content isn't escaped, which means it could be susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. Ensure that text nodes are properly escaped during rendering.

Write a function `redacted`, which transforms a `Node` and its children, replacing all non-whitespace characters with a redacted character: `â–ˆ`.

Write a function `removingStyles`, which removes all `style` nodes and attributes.

Write a function `removingScripts`, which removes all `script` nodes and attributes with the `on` prefix (like `onclick`).

Write a function `plainText`, which transforms HTML into human-readable text, which might be useful for rendering plain-text emails from HTML content.

One of the most popular way of rendering HTML is to use a templating language (Swift, for example, has [Stencil](https://github.com/stencilproject/Stencil)). What are some of the pros and cons of using a templating language over a DSL.
