We finish our introduction to DSLs by adding two new features to our toy example: support for multiple variables and support for let-bindings so that we can share subexpressions within a larger expression. With these fundamentals out of the way, we will be ready to tackle a real-world DSL soon!

In this exercise we are going to implement a function `D: (String) -> (Expr) -> Expr` that computes the
derivative of any expression you give it. This may sound scary, but we'll take it one step at a time!

* Let's start simple. The signature `D: (String) -> (Expr) -> Expr` represents the concept of taking the
derivative of an expression _with respect to_ some variable, specified by the `String` argument. Write down
the signature of this function, and call the string argument `variable`. This string is the variable with
respect to which you will be differentiating. Also implement the body as a closure that takes a single
argument (the expression), and inside the closure implement the `switch` over that argument while leaving all
the cases unimplemented.

* Derivatives have the simple property that they _annihilate_ constants: `D(1) = 0`, `D(-1) = 0`, `D(2) = 0`,
i.e. the derivate of any constant is zero. Use this fact to implement the `.lit` case in the `switch` you
defined above.

* Derivatives also have a simple property for variables. The derivative of a variable with respect to that
variable is simply `1`, and the derivative of any variable with respect to any _other_ variable is `0`. Use
this fact to implement the `.var` case in the `switch` you defined above.

* Derivatives have the wonderful property that they _distribute_ over addition: `D(f + g) = D(f) + D(g)`,
i.e. the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. Use this fact to implement the `.add` case
in the `switch` you defined above.

* Derivatives have a slightly more complicated relationship with multplication. It is _not_ true that
derivatives distribute over multiplication, but they do something close: `D(f * g) = D(f) * g + f * D(g)`.
Use this fact to implement the `.mul` case in the `switch` you defined above.

* Finally, derivatives have an even more complicated relationship with let-bindings:
`D(f >>> g) = D(f) * (f >>> D(g))`, where here we are using `>>>` as a shorthand to represent the idea that
let-bindings are essentially function composition. It's a lot to take in, but what this is saying is that
you take the derivative of the expression you are binding `D(f)`, multiply that with the derivative of the
subexpression that uses the binding `D(g)` pre-composed with the binding `f >>> D(g)`. Use this fact to
implement the `.bind` case in the `switch` you defined above.

If you can solve these exercises, you've essentially done a semester's worth of calculus!
