        It’s pretty incredible how easy it is to test such a complex and subtle flow. We are testing how our code would behave if Game Center started sending back errors, and these kinds of unhappy paths are usually the least tested in code bases because typically they are a pain to get test coverage on.

        So, that’s a very quick tour of how the Composable Architecture is used in isowords. We just want to iterate that indeed you can build a complex application with the Composable Architecture, and indeed a single source of truth can power the entire app. And when you do this it can be very easy to jump into any part of the application and have some idea of what is going on because the domain, logic and view are nicely separated and understandable in isolation.

        Now that we have a broad overview of how the project is structured, let’s dive deeper into some particular features of isowords to see how they were actually built. Let’s start with one of my favorites: onboarding.

        Onboarding is the first thing people see when they come to the app, and it should be short and engaging so that people actually complete it because there are some tricks that one needs to know to enjoy the game, such as double tapping a cube to remove it.

        We’ve settled on a user experience that has the player complete a few simple tasks. First we have them find 3 simple words with more and more letters revealed so that they can experience what it’s like to connect letters together, and most important, finding the last word causes a cube to remove, which is the key game mechanic behind isowords.

        The user experience for onboarding is very important, but so is the developer experience for building onboarding. The easier it is for us to build rich experiences like this the more likely we are to do it, and the more likely we are to not accidentally break it in the future as our application evolves.

        If we approach this in a naive way we may be tempted to sprinkle code throughout our core game feature to get the job done. We’d add extra state to track things that are only specific to onboarding, we’d expose little escape hatches in various parts of the game so that we could hook into certain events, like when a specific word is highlighted on the cube, and we’d litter our view with additional logic to hide things not important for onboarding and show new things that are important for onboarding.

        However, we were able to implement this onboarding feature without adding a single line of code to the core game feature. It is entirely an additional layer that is put on top of the game, and it is done using techniques that we described [in our series of episodes](/collections/swiftui/redactions) exploring SwiftUI’s redaction feature, which gave us the opportunity to show how to build an onboarding feature for a todo app.

        Let's take a look at the onboarding feature.

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        We can start by hopping over to `OnboardingView.swift` where the majority of onboarding code resides, and we can take advantage of our hyper-modularization to switch our active target to `OnboardingFeature` so that we build only what is necessary for this feature. No need to build the entire application target anymore.
        """#,
      timestamp: (3 * 60 + 1),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        The first thing we will see in the file is the `OnboardingState`:
        """#,
      timestamp: (3 * 60 + 21),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""

      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        This clearly shows that we are taking the `GameState` and just adding a bit more state on top of it. It is crucial to see that we did not let any of this additional state infect `GameState`, which should not need to care about onboarding concerns at all.
        """#,
      timestamp: (3 * 60 + 24),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        The other state in here helps us implement the onboarding feature. We have some alert state for prompting the player when they try to skip just to make sure they want to do that. We have a `presentationStyle` value that determines how this onboarding is being shown:
        """#,
      timestamp: (3 * 60 + 40),
      type: .paragraph
    ),

      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Here `.demo` is used when showing onboarding from the App Clip, `.firstLaunch` is used when showing onboarding from the first time you launch the main application, and `.help` is used when you tap on the question mark icon from the home screen. We make small tweaks to onboarding depending on the value of this field.
        """#,
      timestamp: (3 * 60 + 59),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        And finally we have a `Step` value, which is a big enum that describes every single step in the onboarding flow. This is exactly how we designed onboarding in our past [episodes on SwiftUI redactions](/collections/swiftui/redactions).
        """#,
      timestamp: (4 * 60 + 21),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Next we have the onboarding actions enum. This describes all of the things you can do in onboarding, such as interacting with the alert, tapping the next or skip button, along with all the things that happen in the game itself:
        """#,
      timestamp: (4 * 60 + 34),

    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        Next we have the onboarding environment, which holds just a few dependencies that are necessary to run the onboarding feature:
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 0),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

          var audioPlayer: AudioPlayerClient
          var backgroundQueue: AnySchedulerOf<DispatchQueue>

          var feedbackGenerator: FeedbackGeneratorClient
          var lowPowerMode: LowPowerModeClient

      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        We have a computed property on this type that is really interesting. It derives a full `GameEnvironment` from the `OnboardingEnvironment`. The game needs a lot more dependencies to do its job than onboarding does, but for the purpose of onboarding many of them are not needed.
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 6),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        For example, we don’t need an `apiClient` because we don’t need to communicate with the server to do onboarding and we don’t need Game Center or Store Kit because turn-based games and in-app purchases aren’t necessary in onboarding. In fact, more than half of the dependencies are needed at all. And so we employ a technique we explored very recently on Point-Free to fill in all these unnecessary dependencies by creating lightweight “no-op” versions of the dependencies to use:
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 23),

        These `.noop` dependencies basically do nothing. They just return effects that emit no values and complete immediately. They are perfect for sticking in inert dependencies in spots you are forced to provide something.

        Next down the file we come to the `onboardingReducer`, and this is the real workhorse of the onboarding feature:
        """#,

        And then there’s the spots where we tap into the `.game` actions. This allows us to peek inside the game domain and see absolutely everything that is happening.

        - First, the `ApiClient` module contains just the interface of the API client, not any of the actual code for executing network requests. Now typically that network request would just be using `URLSession` under the hood, which comes for free and so incurs no additional size to compile. However, we use our experimental invertible parser printer library to simultaneously power our API client used in the iOS app and the server router that powers the API. Unfortunately that code isn’t super modularized and tidy, and so it builds a lot more than necessary and kinda bloats the code size. So, we separate that heavy stuff in an `ApiClientLive` module so that we don’t have to build any of it unless we absolutely need to. And fortunately we don’t need all that heavy stuff for the app clip because there’s only one single API endpoint that can be access, the game submission endpoint. That allowed us to shave off nearly a full megabyte from the App Clip, which was crucial to getting us under the limit.

        - Second, the `DictionaryClient` contains only the interface to accessing the dictionary, not the actual dictionary itself. In the regular application we use a SQLite database for our dictionary because for certain functionality we need an efficient way of checking if a set of characters matches the prefix of a word. SQLite makes this easy and efficient, whereas if we had a simple array of strings we’d have to do extra work to create an index for the prefixes.

            However, the SQLite file for our dictionary is quite big, over 5 megabytes. That makes sense, after all SQLite has indices and other metadata it needs to pack in, but it also eats away at half of our allotted size for the App Clip. So, that’s why we house the SQLite implementation of the `DictionaryClient` interface in a separate module called `DictionarySqliteClient`, and have another live implementation of the dictionary called `DictionaryFileClient` which is based off a simple flat text file of words and when compressed is only 700 KB, less than 15% of the size.

            This allows us to use the file dictionary client for the App Clip to save some space at the cost of losing a bit of functionality, and use the SQLite dictionary client in the main application where it’s ok to use up a bit of extra space.

        The `.mock` puzzle being used handles constructing the 3x3x3 puzzle and even removes a few cubes so that we can see how shadows are projected. If we ran this on a device we could even test out the gyroscope feature of the game, in which the cube slightly rotates based on the orientation of your device. It’s pretty cool.

        Now you may be wondering why on earth we would take the time to create these preview apps, especially since we also use Xcode previews. Well, Xcode previews are awesome for testing out styling changes and simple behaviors in screens, but they fall short in a few certain situations:

        - First of all, Xcode previews don’t have all the features that the simulator has. For example, in the simulator can you enable slow animations to clearly see how things transition in your application. You can also simulate application lifecycle events such as backgrounding and foregrounding the app. You can also simulate hardware features, such as touch pressure, volume controls, keyboards and more. None of those things are possible in Xcode previews.

        - Further, previews tend to work best in short spurts of time since editing code and navigating through files can invalidate your previews. However the simulator can stay open for a long time since it’s a whole separate process, and so is great for testing parts of your application that take a long time to experience.

        - Also, some technologies don’t work in previews, such as CoreMotion, CoreLocation, StoreKit and more. In fact, the cube view we just demoed does not work at all in Xcode previews because it seems that SceneKit, which is what we use to render the cube, is too heavy for previews. The preview tends to timeout before anything is drawn on the screen. Also there is no gyroscope in previews, or the simulator for that matter, and so if we want an easy way to test that we have no choice but to run on a device.

        - Xcode previews also don’t work great with the debugger. It’s supposed to be possible to attach a debugger, but we haven’t been able to get it to work in a long time. So, if you need to debug just one small part of a feature you are working on it can be great to run it in isolation in a mini app so that it builds quickly and opens immediately the screen you are most interested in. No need to login and navigate through a bunch of screens just to get to the thing you actually want to debug.

        So, from our perspective it is simply necessary to build these little mini apps to get a complete picture of your features. And if you are going to go that route you want these preview apps to build the bare minimum necessary to get something on the screen, and you want it to compile as fast as possible. For example, the `CubeCorePreview` app compiles in just 8 seconds, whereas the full isowords app takes nearly a minute. More than 10 times faster.

        Now when we run the app in the simulator we get something that looks like leaderboards, but unfortunately it’s just a loading indicator that doesn’t even seem to finish.

        Another perk of using previews is they allow you to run your application in controlled or mocked environments without letting that debug code infiltrate your production code. It can be all too easy to sprinkle in a little bit of test code so that you can force a particular flow in your application, but that can be quite dangerous because you have to remember to remove that code. Since app preview targets are fully separate from your main app target they are completely quarantined, and you don’t have to worry about putting any kind of weird debug code in there.

        Ok, so we’ve now seen that certain choices we made early on in building isowords really paid dividends down the line. Using the Composable Architecture made it easy and straightforward to build an onboarding experience. Highly modularizing our app made it easier to build our App Clip. And modularizing also made it easy for us to build little app previews that compile super fast and allow us to test specific features in isolation.

        This idea is also important in another part of app development that can be pretty arduous and annoying. And that’s preparing assets for the App Store.

        - You either need to run the app on the device and literally take screenshots, but that comes with some downsides.

        - Another approach is to have a designer mock up the screenshots in a more controlled, calculated environment like Figma or Sketch. But this also has downsides:
            - The screenshots won’t be exactly how the app looks. No matter how much you like pixel perfect designs there’s always going to be some deviation between the mock ups and what actually renders on a device.
            - It also adds a dependency between you and submitting to the app store. Every time a screen gets substantially updated and you want to update the screenshots you will have to talk to your designer to get them to update the template.

        Neither of these ways of creating app store screens is ideal. And luckily there’s a better way. [Snapshot testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) is a great way to test visual regressions in your views, and it’s something we’ve talked about a ton on Point-Free, and it’s also the perfect tool for automatically generating App Store screenshots. You get to capture exactly what your app looks like, you get to control the environment that it runs in so you can mock out any and all data, and with a little bit of work you can even stylize and add branding to the images.

We want record a video that is engaging, short and to the point, and demonstrates the basic game mechanics. We could of course use the screen recording feature on the iPhone and just open up the game and start playing.

The most important part of this is it’s all additive on top of the game state. Again we didn’t need to infect the core game logic with any of this, and that’s really great. Things would start to get messy fast if the game code needed to worry about onboarding and trailer logic in addition to its core logic.

We are doing this because the nub view actually lives in UIKit world, and that’s because the cube is drawn in SceneKit which doesn’t currently have any first class SwiftUI support. So, in order to animate it around the screen we actually have to use the `UIView.animate` class method, which we can see if we dive into the implementation of this operator:

        So this is pretty amazing. By using the Composable Architecture we have a nice, data-oriented description of all the actions that can happen in our application, and that makes it trivial to replay a script of user actions to emulate what it’s like for someone to actually play the game. And even better, creating this autonomously running trailer looks no different than any other feature we have built in this application. It consists of some domain, a reducer for the logic, and a view. We didn’t have to hack in any escape hatches or litter our core game code with weird logic just to support the trailer. It just all came basically for free. And we could even write tests for the trailer if we really wanted to, but we haven’t gone that far yet 😁
