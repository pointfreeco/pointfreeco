Control the save and load effects in the favorite primes module by introducing an "Environment" for dependency injection, as covered in [our episode on dependency injection](/episodes/ep16-dependency-injection-made-easy).
"""#
  ),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
Control the save effect inside `testSaveButtonTapped` to assert that when the reducer is called, it returns the expected effect.

Making such an assertion involves introducing local, mutable state to the test that is changed in a predictable way if the controlled effect runs. For example, you could introduce a boolean that flips from `false` to `true` when the effect runs. Then, after you run the effect returned from the reducer (you can use its `sink` method), you can assert that it changed as expected.
"""#
  ),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
Further assert that the save effect:

  - Completes. You can use the overload of `sink` that provides a `receivedCompletion` handler to hook into this event. Use the `expectation` and `wait` methods on the test case to handle this asynchrony.

  - Does not return an action to be fed back into the store. You can introduce an assertion to the `receivedValue` block that fails if it runs.
"""#
  ),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
Control the load effect inside `testLoadButtonTapped` to assert that when the reducer is called, it returns the expected effect.

Assert the load effect completes, as well.

Further, rather than manually feeding the expected `loadedFavoritePrimes` action back into the reducer, extract and feed the action returned by the load test effect instead. Again, use the `expectation` and `wait` methods to handle this asynchrony.
"""#
  ),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
Continuing the previous exercises, control the nth prime API effect in the counter module such that you can test:

  - That the effect completes
  - That the effect feeds the correct action back into the reducer
