We've seen how "enum properties" help close the gap between the ergonomics of accessing data on structs and enums, but defining them by hand requires a _lot_ of boilerplate. This week we join forces with Apple's Swift Syntax library to generate this boilerplate automatically!

One problem with our enum property code generator is that it only handles enum cases with a single associated value. Update it to handle enum cases with _no_ associated values. What type of value does this enum property return?

Update our code generator to handle enum cases with _several_ associated values.
"""),
  Episode.Exercise(problem: """
Update our code generator to handle enum cases with labeled associated values. For example, we defined a `Node` enum in our episode on building a [Swift HTML DSL](/episodes/ep28-an-html-dsl):

``` swift
enum Node {
  case el(tag: String, attributes: [String: String], children: [Node])
  case text(String)
}
```

How might labels enhance our enum properties?

After you add support for labeled enum cases, ensure that the code generator properly handles enum cases with a single, labeled value.
