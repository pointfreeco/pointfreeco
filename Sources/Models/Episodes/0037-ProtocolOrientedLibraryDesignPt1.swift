Perhaps the most popular approach to code reuse and extensibility in Swift is to liberally adopt protocol-oriented programming, and many Swift libraries are designed with protocol-heavy APIs. In today's episode we refactor a sample library to use protocols and examine the pros and cons of this approach.

There's one protocol requirement we missed: the fact that we hard-code the path extension of the snapshot reference to "png". Move this requirement into our protocols. Which protocol does it belong to?

Add a default implementation of path extension so that those conforming their own types to be `Snapshottable` do not need to declare `"png"` every time.

Showing the difference between two images is a matter of using a [Core Image difference filter](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIDifferenceBlendMode). Unfortunately, Apple provides no such API to show the difference between two strings. Implement a line diff algorithm to describe the difference between two strings in Swift.

A popular, human-readable algorithm is called the "patience diff". Here are some resources:

- [Patience Diff, a brief summary](https://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html), [Patience Diff Advantages](https://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html): a brief introduction and description of advantages by the author.

- [diff.py](https://github.com/SamB/debian-codeville/blob/master/Codeville/diff.py), [lcsmatch.py](https://github.com/SamB/debian-codeville/blob/master/Codeville/lcsmatch.py): one of the original implementations, in Python.

- [Enumerating longest increasing subsequences and patience sorting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_sorting#Algorithm_for_finding_a_longest_increasing_subsequence): a paper that describes the algorithm.
