Now that we've looked at how to parse multiple values given a single parser, let's try to parse a single value using multiple parsers! And after defining a bunch of these parser combinators we'll finally be able to ask: "what's the point!?"

Many higher-order functions on `Array` are also useful to define on `Parser` as parser combinators. As an example, define a `compactMap` with the following signature: `((A) -> B?) -> (Parser<A>) -> Parser<B>`.

Redefine the `double` parser using parser combinators like `oneOf` to be more resilient than the one we've currently defined. It should handle positive and negative numbers and ignore trailing decimals. _I.e._ it should parse `"1"` as `1.0`, `"-42"` as `-42.0`, `"+50"` as `50.0`, and "-123.456.789" as `-123.456` without consuming `".789"`.
