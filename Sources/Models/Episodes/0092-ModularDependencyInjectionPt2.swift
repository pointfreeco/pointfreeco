Now that we've baked the "environment" of dependencies directly into the Composable Architecture, we're ready to refactor our app's frameworks and tests to work with them in a modular and more lightweight way.

Update the favorite primes module to hit Wolfram Alpha and show an alert, just as the counter module does when the "What is the nth prime?" button is tapped.

Ensure that the root reducer shares the same dependency with each module.
