Randomness is a topic that may not seem so functional, but it gives us a wonderful opportunity to explore composition. After a survey of what randomness looks like in Swift today, we'll build a complex set of random APIs from just a single unit.

Create a function called `frequency` that takes an array of pairs, `[(Int, Gen<A>)]`, to create a `Gen<A>` such that `(2, gen)` is twice as likely to be run than a `(1, gen)`.

Extend `Gen` with an `optional` computed property that returns a generator that returns `nil` a quarter of the time. What other generators can you compose this from?

Extend `Gen` with a `filter` method that returns a generator that filters out random entries that don't match the predicate. What kinds of problems may this function have?

Create a `string` generator of type `Gen<String>` that randomly produces a randomly-sized string of any unicode character. What smaller generators do you composed it from?

Redefine `element(of:)` to work with any `Collection`. Can it also be redefined in terms of `Sequence`?

The `Gen` type has `map` defined it, which, as we've seen in the past, allows us to consider what `zip` might look like. Define `zip2` on `Gen`:

``` swift
func zip2<A, B>(_ ga: Gen<A>, _ gb: Gen<B>) -> Gen<(A, B)>
```

With `zip2` and `zip2(with:)` defined, define higher-order `zip3` and `zip3(with:)` and explore some uses. What functionality does `zip` provide our `Gen` type?
