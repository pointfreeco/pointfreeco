Not only can we easily redact the logic from a view using the Composable Architecture, but we can also insert new logic into our views without making any changes to the core logic of the view. To demonstrate this we will build an onboarding flow for a more complex application.

The `unredacted` helper is super cool, but it might be nicer to define a more general view modifier that can transform the current view in a trailing closure. Define an `applying` helper that would allow us to replace our `unredacted` code above:

```swift
//.unredacted(if: self.onboardingStep == .filters)
.applying {
  if self.onboardingStep == .filters {
    $0.unredacted()
  } else {
    $0
  }
}
```
