      The `unredacted` helper is super cool, but it might be nicer to define a more general view modifier that can transform the current view in a trailing closure. Define an `applying` helper that would allow us to replace our `unredacted` code above:

      ```swift
      //.unredacted(if: self.onboardingStep == .filters)
      .applying {
        if self.onboardingStep == .filters {
          $0.unredacted()
        } else {
          $0
        }
