        First, we spent 5 weeks understanding concurrency from past to present to future, starting with threads and queues, and ending with Swift’s new concurrency tools. The new tools were modeled on two important ideas: structured concurrency, which allows you to write asynchronous and concurrent code in a style that mostly looks like regular synchronous code; and cooperation, which allows any number of tasks to make use of a smaller thread pool in a responsible and cooperative manner.

        Then we spent another 5 weeks applying all of those ideas to our library, the Composable Architecture, in order to understand how the new concurrency tools could improve the library. We saw that not only could they greatly improve how we construct effects, but it even improves how we tie the lifetime of effects to the lifetime of views, all the while never losing out on testability. Someday, hopefully in the near future, we may even be able to further disentangle the library from Combine, and there will be even bigger gains to be had when that happens.

        Once we have the `index` of the value as well as the value we want to send into the system, we can check if we are on the first index, if so we just synchronously send that value through, otherwise we construct an effect that emits the value after a small delay, but we also have to be sure to erase it to the `Effect` type:

        This code gets the job done, but it is intense for something that should be simple. It’s definitely a lot better than how one would construct these kinds of things before we had Combine, such as using `DispatchQueue`s, but it’s still a lot more verbose and obtuse than how the equivalent code could look in a world where we have structured concurrency.

        This await represents the time it takes for the action to be sent, and for the resulting effect to start up. Due to the intricacies and complexities of how concurrent code runs in Swift, we have no guarantees on when exactly a new asynchronous context will begin, and so we do our best to suspend until this happens. This can be handy for asserting on what happens in `fireAndForget` effects after sending an action.

        First we perform something called “authentication”, and then in parallel and without waiting for authentication to finish, we start listening for Game Center events, which is what we use for turn based games.

        The `authenticate` method is long and complicated, but it now at least reads linearly and from top-to-bottom. First we try to authenticate with Game Center, and if that fails we silently ignore any errors because even if the user doesn’t have Game Center configured we still want to fetch daily challenges.

        Once we get passed Game Center authentication we then authenticate with our server by passing along all of the info from Game Center, such as their player ID and display name. When we get a response from our server we send it back into the system so that we can react to it, in particular we use data from that response to determine whether or not we should show a banner at the bottom of the screen to nag you to upgrade to the fully paid version of the app.

        Then, after all of the authentication logic we perform 4 units of work, all in parallel. We fetch a config file from the server, we fetch the details for today’s daily challenge, we fetch the user’s “week in review”, which just has some top-level stats about their scores for the past week, and we fetch any active turn based games from Game Center. Each of these units of work is completely independent from the other, but we want to wait until the user is fully authenticated before kicking them off. This is incredibly easy to express in structured concurrency but was incredibly difficult in Combine.

        And then finally the `listenForGameCenterEvents` function can simply `for await` over all events that game center emits, and we can react to them, such as loading fresh turn-based match data.

        Again, it is absolutely incredible how much simpler this is than the Combine-based version. Yes, this effect is incredibly complicated, but this is essential complexity due to everything we need to get done for this feature. Perhaps we could do more work to break this out into smaller functions or something, but at the end of the day its essential complexity remains roughly the same.

        However, when the code was written with Combine, we added accidental complexity due to the nature of Combine that had nothing to do with the what we were trying to accomplish. We were forced to break up effects into small pieces just because it’s difficult to insert logic into publishers, and we had to use `flatMap` and indent our code a level just to chain two asynchronous tasks together, and the code did not even read from top-to-bottom

        I won't even show what this code looked like in Combine, but we kick off a complex effect when the view appears. We run three asynchronous jobs all in parallel using task groups:

        This also uses a tool that is new in the library but we haven’t discussed in episodes. We can mark just a small part of the effect to be cancellable by an id, and if later we cancel that id, only this part will stop execution:

        So, that concludes this episode on showing off some more real world examples of how structured concurrency can massively improve existing Composable Architecture applications. It is by far the biggest update to the library since we released it over 2 years ago, and we think it will help simplify how people construct effects in their applications. We even think that testing in the Composable Architecture is perhaps even the best way to test asynchronous code in Swift, just in general. It provides all of the necessary tools for awaiting asynchronous work and making assertions on what happens during that work.
