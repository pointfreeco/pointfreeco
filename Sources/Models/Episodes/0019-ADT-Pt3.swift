Our third installment of algebraic data types explores how generics and recursive data types manifest themselves in algebra. This exploration allows us to construct a useful, precise type that can be useful in everyday programming.

Implement the `exp` function on `NaturalNumber` that takes a number to a power:

Conform `NaturalNumber` to the `Comparable` protocol.

Implement `min` and `max` functions for `NaturalNumber`.

How could you implement *all* integers (both positive and negative) as an algebraic data type? Define all of the above functions and conformances on that type.

What familiar type is `List<Void>` equivalent to? Write `to` and `from` functions between those types showing how to travel back-and-forth between them.

Consider the type `enum List<A, B> { cae empty; case cons(A, B) }`. It's kinda like list without recursion, where the recursive part has just been replaced with another generic. Now consider the strange type:

```
enum Fix<A> {
  case fix(ListF<A, Fix<A>>)
}
```

Construct a few values of this type. What other type does `Fix` seem to resemble?

Construct an explicit mapping between the `List<A>` and `Fix<A>` types by implementing:

* `func to<A>(_ list: List<A>) -> Fix<A>`
* `func from<A>(_ fix: Fix<A>) -> List<A>`

The type `Fix` is known as the "fixed-point" of `List`. It is more generic than just dealing with lists, but unfortunately Swift does not have the type feature (higher-kinded types) to allow us to express this.
