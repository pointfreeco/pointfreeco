Now that we know that SwiftUI state management seems biased towards structs, let's fix it. We'll show how to write custom transformations on bindings so that we can use enums to model our domains precisely without muddying our views, and it turns out that case paths are the perfect tool for this job.

To learn more about how enums and structs are related to each other, and to understand why we were led to define the concept of "case paths", check out this collection of episodes:

> Enums are one of Swift's most notable, powerful features, and as Swift developers we love them and are lucky to have them! By contrasting them with their more familiar counterpart, structs, we can learn interesting things about them, unlocking ergonomics and functionality that the Swift language could learn from.
