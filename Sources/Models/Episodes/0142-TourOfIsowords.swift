As most of our viewers know we’ve been working on a new project called [isowords](https://www.isowords.xyz), a word game built in SwiftUI and [the Composable Architecture](/collections/composable-architecture), and just a few weeks ago we simultaneously released the game and [open sourced](/blog/posts/55-open-sourcing-isowords) the entire [code base](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords), including the server that powers the backend.

We’ve given a few peeks at the code in recent episodes to show how to apply some of the concepts we’ve covered. For example, we showed [how we employ animated schedulers](/episodes/ep136-swiftui-animation-the-basics) to be very focused in what kinds of things we want to animate when effects execute. This allowed us to fix a lot of glitches that would have occurred if we could only use implicit SwiftUI animations. And we looked at how we make use of [failing](/episodes/ep139-better-test-dependencies-failability), [immediate](/episodes/ep140-better-test-dependencies-immediacy) and [no-op](/episodes/ep141-better-test-dependencies-the-point) schedulers when writing expressive tests and creating SwiftUI previews that exercise more of the view’s logic than just simple transformations of data into view hierarchy.

- The `isowords` Xcode project holds all app targets for the project, such as the main iOS client target, the app clip target, and something we call “preview” targets, which we will get into more later. The cool thing here is that these targets contain no “real” code. They act as the entry point for the targets, serving only to construct views to kick off the application. In fact, the entire project only contains 700 lines of Swift code spread across 10 app targets, so that’s an average of 70 lines of code per target.

- The “real” code all lives in the `isowords` SPM package. This package currently holds 91 modules for both the iOS client and server, and contains nearly 50k lines of code. The `Package.swift` is big and it’s structured a little strangely, but that’s simply because we need to support libraries that build only for iOS along side some that build only for Mac and Linux, as well as some that build for both. So we have the `Package.swift` split into 3 sections for those three styles of target.

    This may seem extreme, but it comes with a ton of benefits. Most of these modules have very few dependencies and so build very quickly. Further, the smaller a module the better the build tools behave, such as SwiftUI previews, syntax highlighting and more. Also, by hyper-modularizing the code base we were able to easily develop an App Clip experience by just including the small bits of functionality we needed, which is very important since App Clips have a 10 MB size limit, uncompressed.

This Xcode project structure may seem a little odd to you, but in practice it’s actually pretty great. We have found it to be the easiest way to offload a lot of responsibilities from Xcode and give them to SPM. For example, we no longer fiddle with Xcode targets anytime we want a shareable library. With just a few small edits to the `Package.swift` file we can create a new library and have other libraries depend on it, and then immediately start writing code for the library.

- It gets Xcode out of the way for a lot of things, reduces friction to modularizing, and does so without any external tools. There are other ways to achieve something like this, such as using an Xcode project generator, but it’s nice that we do a lot just with what Xcode gives us today.

- We very rarely need to resolve diffs between Xcode project files when merging code, which is often inscrutable and difficult to get right. In fact, the Xcode project shows up in PR diffs so infrequently that it now catches our eye and we further scrutinize the diff to make sure it was intended.

    Instead of Xcode project changes we now simply see changes in the Package.swift file, which is easy to understand, or we see changes in any shared Xcode schemes, which are a simple file format with one small file for each target.

However, not everything is perfect in the world of SPM, there are some caveats that we’d like to mention:
"""#,
      timestamp: (6*60 + 49),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
- First, in order for Xcode to automatically generate a scheme for each of our SPM modules, which are the things listed up in the top picker (ctrl+0), we must describe [show this in Package.swift] the module as a library at the top level and then again as a target down below. I’m sure there’s a good reason for this duplication, but it is a little unfortunate.
"""#,
      timestamp: (6*60 + 56),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
- Further, there is a little bit of manual management necessary when it comes to creating test targets. It is easy enough to create a test target, you simply add a new `.testTarget` line to your `Package.swift` and SPM will take care of creating that target. However, if you want to be able to work in your main feature target and be able to hit cmd+U to run the corresponding tests you have to open up the feature’s scheme and explicitly add that test target. It would be great if SPM could do this automatically for us since it seems to have all the information necessary.
"""#,
      timestamp: (7*60 + 28),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
- Next, SPM specifies the platforms that can be built at the package level, not the target level. So, for us to develop iOS-only modules, Mac/Linux-only modules, and shared modules we technically should be splitting into at least 3 packages. But that is a little annoying to manage 3 separate packages since it’s additional directory structures to maintain. Even worse, we actually have integration tests that exercise both iOS code and server code at the same time, which means we’d also need a 4th package just for integration tests. We decided it was not worth that trouble, and so we choose to go a little bit against the grain of SPM and house everything in a single package and then use environment variables to selectively add targets to the package.
"""#,
      timestamp: (8*60 + 28),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
- Because we house everything in a single package, and because platforms is specified at the package level, we technically can build targets on platforms that aren’t supported. For example, we can try building the `SettingsFeature` for macOS, but that of course will fail instantly because it has iOS-specific code. So, we have to be a little extra vigilant about keeping an eye on which platform is being built.
"""#,
      timestamp: (9*60 + 54),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
- Next, by keeping the SPM package at the root of the project we run the risk of exposing things in Xcode that we do not expect. For example, if we simply create a directory at the root, call it `blob`. it will suddenly show up in the Xcode side bar. We do not want this. All we want to show in the `isowords` package is just the `Sources` and `Tests`.

    However, you will notice that we have an `App`, `Assets` and `Bootstrap` directory at the root of the project and yet those directories do not appear in the side bar. The way we accomplish this is by dropping a stub of a `Package.swift` in the directory, which is enough to tell Xcode not to display that directory since it thinks it is its own SPM package:

      timestamp: (10*60 + 31),

- Another caveat is that as of Xcode 12.4 the symbols inside an SPM package are not properly symbolicated, and so crashes from code in an SPM package may not produce helpful stack traces. This bug is supposed to be [fixed in Xcode 12.5](https://forums.swift.org/t/incomplete-crash-log-symbolication-for-bitcode-enabled-apps-linked-with-packages-containing-resources/42696/4).

Now we’ve landed on the home screen of the application, which typically shows us how many people have played the daily challenge so far, but right now it’s just showing a gray rectangle.

This is a very important principle for the Composable Architecture. We should not perform any logic in the view because it is very difficult to test that logic.

So that’s the entry point to the app, but also the great thing about the Composable Architecture is that literally every screen of the app is basically built in the exact same way. You have the domain, consisting of state, actions, and environment; you’ve got the reducer that glues up the domain in order to implement your feature’s logic; and then you have the view that holds onto a store of the domain so that it can observe state changes and send actions. Literally every feature of isowords that you will find in this code base follows this pattern.

Because while Swift has gotten much better at incremental builds, it still happens quite often that we need to build a whole module from scratch.

There’s a little bit of set up work to craft the environment of dependencies for the test:

We always start with a failing environment. That is, an environment such that if any of its dependencies are ever executed it will immediately fail the test suite.

Once the environment is set up we set up the test store so that we can assert on how actions cause the state to change, as well as how effects are executed in the system:

      type: .paragraph

Now tapping this button doesn’t cause state to change, and so that’s why there is nothing else on this line. It also doesn’t execute any effects that feed data back into the system, and so that’s why we don’t have any `store.receive` statements either. All that happens when this button is tapped is a fire-and-forget effect is executed in order to show some Game Center UI for starting a turn-based game, and so the only way to verify that happened is by checking that the corresponding effect in the environment was executed:

A little further down the file there’s a test that shows what happens when we tap on the “View past games” button:

An important aspect of this test is the fact that the environment is fully stubbed out to be failing.

The test simply shows how navigation causes the state’s `route` to change to the `.pastGames` route, which will cause the view to trigger a drill down event. And then when we set navigation to `nil` it causes the `route` to be cleared, which will trigger a drill out.

If we hop over to `PastGamesTests.swift` we’ll see some slightly more complicated tests, but still following the same pattern as the other tests.

Now we can’t stop here. Tapping that button caused an effect to be executed, which fed data back into the system, and we have to assert on that or else the test will fail. In fact, let’s comment out the rest of the test just to make sure that happens:

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

So, we need to bring back the `store.receive`, which allows us to explicitly tell the test store that we expect an action to be fed back into the system, in particular a response from the Game Center rematch request:

And we further have to assert on how the state changed after we got this action from the effect. In particular, the boolean that indicates if the request is in flight flips back to `false`, and we show an alert to communicate to the user that we couldn’t start the rematch:
