So, what's the point of forgoing the protocols and designing dependencies with simple data types? It can be summed up in 3 words: testing, testing, testing. We can now easily write tests that exercise every aspect of our application, including its reliance on internet connectivity and location services.

Because our dependencies are simple value types we can more easily transform them. We can even define "higher-order" dependencies, or functions that take a dependency as input and transform it into a new dependency returned as output.

As an example, try implementing a method on `WeatherClient` that returns a brand new weather client with all of its endpoints artificially slowed down by a second.

```swift
extension WeatherClient {
  func slowed() -> Self {
    fatalError("unimplemented")
  }
}
```
"""#,
    solution: #"""
You can create a new weather client by passing along all of the existing client's endpoints with Combine's `delay` operator attached.

```swift
extension WeatherClient {
  func slowed() -> Self {
    Self(
      weather: {
        self.weather($0)
          .delay(for: 1, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
          .eraseToAnyPublisher()
      },
      searchLocations: {
        self.searchLocations($0)
          .delay(for: 1, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)
          .eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }
    )
  }
}

Implement a method on `LocationClient` that can override an existing location client to behave as if it were at a specific location.

```swift
extension LocationClient {
  func located(
    atLatitude latitude: CLLocationDegrees,
    longitude: CLLocationDegrees
  ) -> Self {
    fatalError("unimplemented")
  }
}
```
"""#,
    solution: #"""
You can create a new location client by passing along each endpoint and transforming the delegate publisher to modify the `didUpdateLocations` event.

```swift
extension LocationClient {
  func located(
    atLatitude latitude: CLLocationDegrees,
    longitude: CLLocationDegrees
  ) -> Self {
    Self(
      authorizationStatus: self.authorizationStatus,
      requestWhenInUseAuthorization: self.requestWhenInUseAuthorization,
      requestLocation: self.requestLocation,
      delegate: self.delegate
        .map { event -> DelegateEvent in
          guard case .didUpdateLocations = event else { return event }
          let location = CLLocation(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude)
          return .didUpdateLocations([location])
        }
        .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    )
