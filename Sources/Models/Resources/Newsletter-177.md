In less than 24 hours we are going live! Join us June 25th at 9am PDT (4pm GMT) where we will 
discuss the powerful new CloudKit synchronization tools coming to our popular SwiftData alternative:
[SharingGRDB]. During the live stream we will add synchronization to an existing app with SQLite
persistence, and show how to enable sharing of data with other iCloud users. It only takes a few 
lines of code, and it feels almost magical!

We have also already [opened the Q&A](/live) for questions from our community. Feel free to ask
us anything about our libraries, our episodes, WWDC25, or really anything!
