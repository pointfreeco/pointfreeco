In less than 48 hours we are going live! Join us at 9am PDT (4pm GMT) where we will discuss
the powerful new CloudKit synchronization tools coming to our popular SwiftData alternative:
[SharingGRDB]. During the live stream we will add synchronization to an existing app with SQLite
persistence, and show to enable sharing of data with other iCloud users. It only takes a few lines
of code, and it feels almost magical!

We have also already [opened the Q&A](/live) for questions from our community. Feel free to ask
us anything about our libraries, our episodes, WWDC25, or really anything!
