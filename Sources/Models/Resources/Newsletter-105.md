It's been just under two months since we kicked off our [navigation beta](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/discussions/1944), in
which we released an assortment of tools to manage presentation in the Composable
Architecture. This included tools for dealing with alerts, confirmation dialogs, sheets,
popovers, fullscreen covers, pre-iOS 16 navigation links, and the tree-based
[`navigationDestination`][nav-dest-tree] view modifier. The beta notably did **not** provide
tools for iOS 16's `NavigationStack`, but that changes today.

## Composable Stack Navigation Basics

Like last time, we're not going to give a detailed overview of these new tools and how we
motivated or designed them (see the forthcoming [episodes][stacks-ep] for that ðŸ˜‰), and
documentation is still in-progress, but here is a very quick overview of the stack-based tools
and how to use them.

  * When a root feature contains a navigation stack of elements to be presented, you will
    enhance its domain using the new `StackState` and `StackAction` types:

    ```swift
    struct Root: ReducerProtocol {
      struct State {
        var path = StackState<Child.State>()
        â€¦
      }
      enum Action {
        case path(StackAction<Child.State, Child.Action>)
        â€¦
      }
    }
    ```

    `StackState` is a collection type that is specialized for navigation operations in the
    Composable Architecture, where each element represents a screen in the stack that is
    powered by its own reducer. It is similar to SwiftUI's [`NavigationPath`][nav-path-docs],
    and has many of the same operations like `append` and `removeLast`, but it is not
    type-erased: you can freely inspect and mutate the data inside.

  * Then you will make use of the new, special `forEach` reducer operator that can single out
    the stack state and action, and run the child feature on that element when it is active:

    ```swift
    var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
      Reduce { state, action in
        â€¦
      }
      .forEach(\.path, action: /Action.path) {
        Child()
      }
    }
    ```

    That's all that is needed as far as the domain and reducer is concerned. The `forEach`
    operator has been with the library since the beginning, but is now enhanced with super
    powers, including automatically cancelling child effects when they are dismissed, and
    more.

  * The last step is in the view, where the library provides a new `NavigationStackStore`
    view, which powers a `NavigationStack` and its destinations using a store.

    ```swift
    struct RootView: View {
      let store: StoreOf<Root>

      var body: some View {
        NavigationStackStore(
          store.scope(state: \.path, action: { .path($0) })
        ) {
          Text("Welcome")
        } destination: { store in
          ChildView(store: store)
        }
      }
    }
    ```


That's the basics. There's a whole lot more to learn, but we will leave it at that for now,
and we encourage you to explore the updated branch when you get a chance.

## Trying the beta

These new stack-based tools are already available on the `navigation-beta` branch. If you've
been testing things so far, you can pull the latest and immediately make use of these tools.
The [1.0
preview](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/discussions/1905)
likewise has been updated with the latest, greatest tools. Otherwise, you can update your SPM
dependencies to point to the `navigation-beta` branch:

```swift
.package(
  url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture",
  branch: "navigation-beta"
),
```

We hope these tools fill a gap in the library and make it ready for its first major release.
