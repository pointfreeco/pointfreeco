## [Back to Basics: Equatable & Hashable][eq-hash-collection]

This year we began a new type of episode arc on Point-Free called "Back to Basics". In these 
episodes we will break down a foundational concept in Swift into its simplest components so that
we can achieve an expertise understanding of the topic. We began with a seemingly simple subject:
the [`Equatable` and `Hashable`][eq-hash-collection] protocols in Swift.

However, looks can be deceiving. These protocols are not like most other protocols in the language.
They have a very formal, mathematical specification, and if your implementation runs afoul of its
semantics you will be in for a world of hurt. Reasonable looking code will have very unreasonable
behavior.

## [SQLite][sqlite-collection]

At the end of the year we turned our attention to advanced topics in data persistence, starting
with an [introduction to SQLite][sqlite-collection]. Thanks to Swift's wonderful interoperability 
with C, we get immediate access to everything SQLite has to offer. Our series serves as a crash
course in calling C libraries from Swift, including dealing with pointers, as well as the basics
of what SQLite has to offer.

After covering the basics of the SQLite C library we move onto a more modern way of dealing with 
SQLite in Swift projects by exploring the [GRDB](http://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) library
by [Gwendal RouÃ©](http://github.com/groue). This library provides a modern Swift interface over
the SQLite C library, and gives one easy and safe access to some of SQLite's most advanced
functionality.

## [Cross-Platform Swift][cross-platform-collection]

Our personal favorite series from the year, we explored what Swift looks like on platforms other
than Apple's. The primary platform we explore is WebAssembly (Wasm) where we show how to 
build a Swift application that runs in a web browser. The application involves complex side effects
(timers and network requests) as well as navigation (alerts and modals), and it's built in 100%
pure, cross-platform Swift. This means that with a little bit of extra work the application could be 
further ported to Windows, Linux, and beyond!

And while this series may seem like it is merely about writing code that runs in a browser, the
true impetus of this series is to explore advance domain modeling techniques. By writing the logic
and behavior of your features in a way that is quarantined from view-related concerns we instantly
unlock the ability to run that features in a variety of mediums. It doesn't take much work to do,
but the payoffs are huge.

## Modern UIKit

## Shared State in the Composable Architecture

## [Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui]

At the beginning of the year we finished our [7-part series][modern-swiftui] on what we feel it 
takes to build a modern SwiftUI application. We took inspiration from one of Apple's own moderately 
complex demos, [Scrumdinger][scrumdinger], and we rebuilt it with a focus on domain modeling for 
navigation, side effects, dependencies and testing. By the end we were able to accomplish things in 
our code base that were not so easy in Apple's, such as deep-linking, more cohesive previews, and 
simple unit testing.

We ended up open-sourcing the application we built, which we call [SyncUps][syncups]. We also 
encouraged others to share how they like to build modern, complex SwiftUI applications by rebuilding
Apple's Scrumdinger in the style of their choice, and sharing with the community.

Our [Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui] series ended long before the release of Swift 5.9's Observation
framework, and so we could not use any of those tools during the episodes. But we later had a 
[dedicated episode][observation-in-practice] to refactoring the SyncUps app to use the new 
`@Observable` macro. We found that we could delete a lot of code and simplify a lot of things, 
although we did run into one gnarly gotcha with the Observation framework.

## [Composable Architecture 1.0][tca-1.0-collection]

After more than 3 years of development we [finally released 1.0][tca-1.0-blog] of the Composable 
Architecture. To celebrate we released a [7-part series of episodes][tca-1.0-collection] to 
build a moderately complex app from scratch and show how to best make use of many of the tools
that come with the library.

And the app we built was directly inspired from our [Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui] series where
we rebuilt Apple's [Scrumdinger][scrumdinger] application. But this time we rebuilt it with the
Composable Architecture, and saw a number of benefits, including the ability to use value types
for domain modeling instead of reference types, simpler composition and navigation APIs, and
truly powerful and exhaustive testing.

## [Deep dive into `@Observable`][observation-collection]

Most recently this year we dove _deep_ into the new Observation framework in Swift 5.9 in a 
[4-part series][observation-collection]:

* We showed off the past tools, pre-Observation, and demonstrated that while they got the job done 
  there was a lot to be desired. 
* Then we showed off what the new tools were capable of, and it was quite amazing. You can build 
  your SwiftUI features in a simpler, more naive manner, and everything somehow just magically
  works! We even dipped our toes into the actual open source code in the Observation framework so
  that we could get a better understanding of how everything works.
* However, the Observation tools do have some gotchas, so we dedicated an entire episode to just 
  that so that you can best wield the tools. Otherwise you run the risk of over-observing state or 
  glitchy views.
* And finally we explored a theoretical future of what `@Observable` could look like if it were
  allowed to be applied to structs. There are a lot of reasons to want that, but unfortunately it's
  just not quite possible in Swift today.

## [Reliable Async Testing][reliable-testing]

One of the best new features to be added to Swift in the past few years was concurrency. It makes 
complex asynchronous code short and succinct, it provides all new tools for making concurrent code 
safe, and it unlocks all new patterns that were previously difficult to imagine.

However, testing code involving Swift's new asynchronous tools remained elusive. It seems the moment
you introduce the `async` or `await` keyword to your code you open up Pandora's box of
non-determinism and flakiness in your code that is nearly impossible to test. You are forced to
sprinkle `Task.yield`s or `Task.sleep`s throughout your tests just to push things forward and assert
on how your feature is behaving.

Reliably testing async code was such a problem that we started a 
[discussion][realiable-testing-forums] on the Swift forums to see what could be done about the 
situationâ€¦and unfortunately there's not much. At least not much in the way of official tools 
provided by Swift.

But, over the course of [5 episodes][reliable-testing] we broken down why testing async code in 
Swift is so difficult, and provided a solution. We even packaged the tool up into an
[open-source library][concurrency-extras-gh] that can help any code base test their async code
in a fast and non-deterministic manner.

This only scratches the surface of what we covered in 2024, and we have plenty of exciting topics 
planned for 2025, including bringing `@Observable` to the Composable Architecture, a new fundamental 
change to the Composable Architecture that will unlock capabilities currently impossible, and 
perhaps we will even start to explore some server-side Swift. ðŸ˜€

Be sure to [subscribe today][black-friday-sale] to get access to all of this and more. The
offer is valid for only a few days, so you better hurry!
