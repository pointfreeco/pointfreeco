This is the perfect time to get full access to all of our videos. In the past year we have explored 
many advanced topics of Swift and SwiftUI, including:

* **Modern Persistence**

  Our [current ambitious series][modern-persistence-collection] series of episodes asks "What should
  the persistence layer in a modern application look like?" We attach this problem head on by 
  rebuilding Apple's Reminders app from scratch, and we do not shy away from its most complex 
  features, including complex schemas, foreign key relationships, queries, and more.

* **SQLite**

  We dedicate a [series of episodes to SQLite][sqlite-collection], one of the most impressive 
  software projects in the history of software development. Gaining an expertise to SQL and SQLite 
  can be a huge boon to your career as it is a far reaching skill beyond the Apple walls, and it 
  provides an amazing set of tools for building data-intensive applications with very little work. 

* **SQL Building**
  
  There's no better way to deeply learn SQL than to build a library that is capable of 
  representing any SQL statement as a type-safe and schema-safe expression in Swift. So, we
  designed a [series of episodes][sql-building-collection] that shows how to use some of Swift's
  most advanced features (parameter packs, existentials, key paths, result builders, â€¦) to create
  a SQL building library that rivals any other SQL building library in any other language out there.

* **Back-to-basics: Equatable and Hashable**

  We go back to our roots by dusting off the 
  [mathematical foundations of `Equatable`][back-to-basics] and truly understanding how to properly 
  conform to this ubiquitous protocol. While straightforward for structs, we make the surprising 
  (but 100% correct) discovery that classes should almost never use their stored data to implement 
  `==` or `hash(into:)`, and doing so will lead to disastrous results.

* **Modern UIKit**

  No one was asking for a [modern UIKit series][modern-uikit-collection], but that doesn't mean it 
  didn't deserve to be made! We showed how the Observation framework in Swift allows us to 
  completely  revolutionize how one writes UIKit apps. We can provide powerful state management 
  tools and navigation tools that allow us to write UIKit features in a style that looks very 
  similar to SwiftUI.  

* **Cross-Platform Swift**

  Did you know that Swift runs on more than just Apple's platforms? It runs on Linux, Windows,
  and can even run directly in a browser via Wasm. We [explore this topic][cross-platform-swift]
  by building a moderately complex application that runs in the browser. It manages state, makes
  network requests, and even performs navigation!

And the above is only scratching the surface of what we have covered in the last 6 years since 
Point-Free launched, and we have some truly exciting episodes planned for the rest of the year,
including a powerful new way to automatically
