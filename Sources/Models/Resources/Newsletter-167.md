We will be [live soon](/live), at 9am PST / 5pm GMT!

We will be discussing some of the following:

* Our popular [Sharing][sharing-gh] library, including some aspects that we have not talked about 
much, including how it interacts with **Firebase** and **Wasm**.
* We will live release a brand new open source project that aims to be an **alternative to
SwiftData** for many types of apps.
* We will also give a **sneak peek** at the next series of episodes we are working on, and we
think it's some of our most exciting stuff yet!
* We will answer as many questions from our viewers as humanly possible. You can already add your
question to the [Q&A](/live) (enter a user name and then tap "Ask") and upvote any other questions
that you are interested in.
* And finally, during the livestream we will **give away a yearly subscription** to 7 of our viewers
to celebrate 7 years of Point-Free! ðŸŽ‰

You're not going to want to miss this!
