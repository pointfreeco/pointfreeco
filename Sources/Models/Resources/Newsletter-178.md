We will be discussing some of the following:

* A **sneak peek** at the new CloudKit synchronization tools coming to our popular SwiftData
alternative: [SQLiteData]. In just a few lines of code you can unlock synchronization across
all of your user's devices.
* We will also demo how to make it possible for your users to **share their data** with other iCloud
users for collaboration.
* We will show how easy it is to use these tools by **live coding** a brand new demo and adding
both synchronization and sharing to the app. It will seem like magic! 
* We will **answer as many questions** from our viewers as humanly possible. You can already add your
question to the [Q&A](/live) (enter a user name and then tap "Ask") and upvote any other questions
that you are interested in.

You're not going to want to miss this!
