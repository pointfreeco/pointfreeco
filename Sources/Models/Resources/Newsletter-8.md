> Preamble: What happens when we combine Swift's conditional conformance with codability?

![](https://d1iqsrac68iyd8.cloudfront.net/posts/0008-conditional-coding/poster.png)

Swift 4 introduced the
[`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types)
set of protocols and made working with JSON a breeze, eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate
we previously had to write! Swift 4.1's
[conditional conformance](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/) unlocks even _more_
potential, and lets us delete even _more_ boilerplate. Let's take a look at one particular example.

## Expandable APIs

Many APIs let clients fetch more data in fewer requests by providing a way to include related
resources. For example, the Stripe API supports
["expanding objects"](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects): wherever the API may by
default return a customer ID, the client may instead request a fully expanded customer data type.

In Swift, we can represent the idea of such an expandable object using the following type:

```swift
enum Expandable<Object: Decodable> {
  case id(String)
  case expanded(Object)
}
```

And we can conform this type to `Decodable`, capturing the ability to decode _either_ an id _or_ an
expanded value depending on the payload:

```swift
extension Expandable: Decodable {
  init(decoder: Decoder) throws {
    do {
      self = .id(try String(decoder: decoder))
    } catch {
      self = .expanded(try Object(decoder: decoder))
    }
  }
}
```

With this conformance, we can define a variety of decodable types with expandable properties.

```swift
struct Customer: Decodable {
  let id: String
  let email: String
}

struct Invoice {
  let id: String
  let customer: Expandable<Customer>
}
```

We now have a data type that will decode just fine, regardless of whether or not its `customer`
property is fully expanded or merely an id, and it feels very reusable: any expandable property can
use this `Expandable` type. Unfortunately, it's still way more restrictive than it needs to be.

## Generalizing with Either

Our `Expandable` type is a specialization of another type that's typically called `Either` and it's
typically defined in the following way:

```swift
enum Either<Left, Right> {
  case left(Left)
  case right(Right)
}
```

`Either` is the most generic, non-trivial `enum` that we can define: it has two cases with two
generic, associated values. `Expandable` is an enum that wasn't far off from this definition, and
indeed we could have used `Either` to define `Expandable` using a type alias:

```swift
typealias Expandable<Object>
  = Either<String, Object> where Object: Decodable
```

`Either` doesn't conform to `Decodable`, though, so we've lost the ability to use this definition of
`Expandable` in our earlier, decodable types. We can recover this loss, though, by using conditional
conformance! `Either` can conform to `Decodable` as long as its associated types are decodable.

```swift
extension Either: Decodable where Left: Decodable, Right: Decodable {
  init(decoder: Decoder) throws {
    do {
      self = .left(try Left(decoder: decoder))
    } catch {
      self = .right(try Right(decoder: decoder))
    }
  }
}
```

This short protocol extension fully generalizes the idea of decoding different kinds of values!

But what's this kind of decoding good for other than expandable properties? Well, any time we expect
to decode _either_ one type _or_ another, we can use `Either`. For instance, we can decode API
errors alongside the API data types we hope to fetch. Given a struct that represents an API error:

```swift
struct StripeError: Decodable {
  let message: String
}
```

We can now conditionally decode an expected data type _or_ an error!

```swift
try decoder.decode(
  Either<Invoice, StripeError>.self,
  from: data
)
```

We were able to reuse our generalized solution for `Expandable` with a totally different use case.
We didn't have to write any more custom decoding logic: `Either` works like an `if`â€”`else` statement
for decoding!

That's two examples. How about two more for good luck?

## Inconsistent APIs

APIs are long-living entities that develop quirks over time. Some endpoints may return a property as
an integer, while others may return that same integer as a string. Our client can remain resilient
and type-safe over time using `Either`, which lets us succinctly capture these two cases!

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
  let id: Either<Int, String>
}
```

## Changing APIs

Let's wrap up with one more example! It's very common to save app state to disk and load it on app
launch. Sometimes, this format changes over time, and older client data needs to migrate to a new
format. If this data is decoded using `Decodable`, we can capture some of this conditional logic
automatically!

```swift
let appData = try decoder.decode(Either<AppData, LegacyAppData>.self, from: data)
switch appData {
case let .left(appData):
  // handle app data
case let .right(legacyAppData):
  // migrate legacy app data
}
```

## Conclusion

Conditional conformance gives us the ability to eliminate a _lot_ of decoding boilerplate in a
completely general, reusable way. If you want to look at some real-world code, we use this technique
