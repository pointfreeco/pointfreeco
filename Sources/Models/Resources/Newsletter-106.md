Over 3 months ago we released the [first beta preview][nav-beta-gh-discussion] of our navigation
tools for the [Composable Architecture][tca-gh]. In that time we have released 16 episodes building
all of the tools [from scratch][tca-nav-collection], and the community has put the new APIs through
the wringer to help make them the best they can be.

We are excited to officially release the tools, making it available to everyone who updates the
library to version [0.54.0][tca-release]. This release brings all the tools you need to concisely
model your domains and drive state off of optionals, enums, and collections.

[tca-release]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.54.0

Join us for a quick tour of the tools, and we also have a [brand new tutorial][tca-tute] and
[articles][tca-nav-article] covering the tools in depth.

## Presentation tools

It is very common to model state-driven navigation with optional values: when the value is non-`nil`
the feature is presented, and when the value is `nil` it is dismissed. We like to call this style of
navigation ["tree-based"][tree-based-article] because feature states nest inside each other to
describe a path through your application, and that forms a tree-like structure.

[tree-based-article]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/treebasednavigation

The Composable Architecture gives you the tools to model you domains concisely using optionals and
enums. For example, suppose you have a list of items and you want to be able to show a sheet to
display a form for adding a new item. We can integrate state and actions together by utilizing the
[`PresentationState`][presentation-state-docs] and [`PresentationAction`][presentation-action-docs]
types:

[presentation-action-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/presentationaction
[presentation-state-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/presentationstate

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable {
    @PresentationState var addItem: ItemFormFeature.State?
    var items: IdentifiedArrayOf<Item> = []
    …
  }

  enum Action: Equatable {
    case addItem(PresentationAction<ItemFormFeature.Action>)
    …
  }
  …
}
```

> The `addItem` state is held as an optional. A non-`nil` value represents that feature is being
> presented, and `nil` presents the feature is dismissed.

Next you can integrate the reducers of the parent and child features by using the
[``ifLet``][iflet-docs] reducer operator, as well as having an action in the parent domain for
populating the child's state to drive navigation:

[iflet-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/reducerprotocol/iflet(_:action:destination:fileid:line:)

```swift
struct InventoryFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State: Equatable { … }
  enum Action: Equatable { … }

  var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
    Reduce<State, Action> { state, action in
      switch action {
      case .addButtonTapped:
        // Populating this state performs the navigation
        state.addItem = ItemFormFeature.State()
        return .none
      …
      }
    }
    .ifLet(\.$addItem, action: /Action.addItem) {
      ItemFormFeature()
    }
  }
}
```

> The key path used with `ifLet` focuses on the `@PresentationState` projected value since it uses
> the `$` syntax. Also note that the action uses a
> [case path](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths), which is analogous to key paths but
> tuned for enums, and uses the forward slash syntax.

That's all that it takes to integrate the domains and logic of the parent and child features. Next
we need to integrate the features' views. This is done using view modifiers that look similar to
SwiftUI's, but are tuned specifically to work with the Composable Architecture.

For example, to show a sheet from the `addItem` state in the `InventoryFeature`, we can use the
`sheet(store:)` modifier that takes a ``Store`` as an argument that is focused on presentation state
and actions:

```swift
struct InventoryView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<InventoryFeature>

  var body: some View {
    List {
      …
    }
    .sheet(
      store: store.scope(
        state: \.$addItem, action: { .addItem($0) }
      )
    ) { store in
      ItemFormView(store: store)
    }
  }
}
```

> We again must specify a key path to the `@PresentationState` projected value, _i.e._ `\.$addItem`.

With those few steps completed the domains and views of the parent and child features are now
integrated together, and when the `addItem` state flips to a non-`nil` value the sheet will be
presented, and when it is `nil`'d out it will be dismissed.

In this example we are using the `.sheet` view modifier, but the library ships with overloads for
all of SwiftUI's navigation APIs that take stores of presentation domain, including:

  * `alert(store:)`
  * `confirmationDialog(store:)`
  * `sheet(store:)`
  * `popover(store:)`
  * `fullScreenCover(store:)`
  * `navigationDestination(store:)`
  * [`NavigationLinkStore`][nav-link-store-docs]

[nav-link-store-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/navigationlinkstore

This should make it possible to use optional state to drive any kind of navigation in a SwiftUI
application.

## Navigation stack tools

While the tree-based style of navigation described above is powerful, it also has some limitations.
It is difficult to model complex, deeply nested navigation, and this is where
["stack-based"][stack-based-article] navigation really shines. This multi-level navigation is driven
by a collection of state, where adding an element to the collection represents drilling down to a
feature, and remove the element represents popping the feature off.

[stack-based-article]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/stackbasednavigation

The tools for this style of navigation include [`StackState`][stack-state-docs],
[`StackAction`][stack-action-docs], and the [`forEach`][foreach-docs] operator, as well as a new
[`NavigationStackStore`][nav-stack-store-docs] view that behaves like `NavigationStack` but is tuned
specifically for the Composable Architecture.

[stack-state-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/stackstate
[stack-action-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/stackaction
[foreach-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/reducerprotocol/foreach(_:action:destination:fileid:line:)
[nav-stack-store-docs]: https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/navigationstackstore

The process of integrating features into a navigation stack largely consists of 2 steps: integrating
the features' domains together, and constructing a `NavigationStackStore` for describing all the
views in the stack. One typically starts by integrating the features' domains together. This
consists of defining a new reducer, typically called `Path`, that holds the domains of all the
features that can be pushed onto the stack:

```swift
struct RootFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  …
  struct Path: ReducerProtocol {
    enum State {
      case addItem(AddFeature.State)
      case detailItem(DetailFeature.State)
      case editItem(EditFeature.State)
    }
    enum Action {
      case addItem(AddFeature.Action)
      case detailItem(DetailFeature.Action)
      case editItem(EditFeature.Action)
    }
    var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
      Scope(state: /State.addItem, action: /Action.addItem) {
        AddFeature()
      }
      Scope(state: /State.editItem, action: /Action.editItem) {
        EditFeature()
      }
      Scope(state: /State.detailItem, action: /Action.detailItem) {
        DetailFeature()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The `Path` reducer is identical to the `Destination` reducer that one creates for tree-based

> for more information.

Once the `Path` reducer is defined we can then hold onto `StackState` and `StackAction` in the
feature that manages the navigation stack:

```swift
struct RootFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  struct State {
    var path = StackState<Path.State>()
    …
  }
  enum Action {
    case path(StackAction<Path.State, Path.Action>)
    …
  }
}
```

> `StackAction` is generic over both state and action of the `Path` domain. This is different from
> `PresentationAction`, which only has a single generic.

And then we must make use of the `forEach` method to integrate the domains of all the features that
can be navigated to with the domain of the parent feature:

```swift
struct RootFeature: ReducerProtocol {
  …
  var body: some ReducerProtocolOf<Self> {
    Reduce { state, action in
      // Core logic for root feature
    }
    .forEach(\.path, action: /Action.path) {
      Path()
    }
  }
}
```

That completes the steps to integrate the child and parent features together for a navigation stack.

Next we must integrate the child and parent views together. This is done by construct a special
version of SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` view that comes with this library, called
`NavigationStackStore`. This view takes 3 arguments: a store focused in on `StackState` and
`StackAction` in your domain, a trailing view builder for the root view of the stack, and another
trailing view builder for all of the views that can be pushed onto the stack:

```swift
NavigationStackStore(
  // Store focused on StackState and StackAction
) {
  // Root view of the navigation stack
} destination: { state in
  switch state {
  // A view for each case of the Path.State enum
  }
}
```

To fill in the first argument you only need to scope your store to the `path` state and `path`
action you already hold in the root feature:

```swift
struct RootView: View {
  let store: StoreOf<RootFeature>

  var body: some View {
    NavigationStackStore(
      path: store.scope(
        state: \.path, action: { .path($0) }
      )
    ) {
      // Root view of the navigation stack
    } destination: { state in
      switch state {
      // A view for each case of the Path.State enum
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The root view can be anything you want, and would typically have some `NavigationLink`s or other
buttons that push new data onto the `StackState` held in your domain.

And the last trailing closure is provided a single piece of the `Path.State` enum so that you can
switch on it:

```swift
} destination: { state in
  switch state {
  case .addItem:
  case .detailItem:
  case .editItem:
  }
}
```

This will give you compile-time guarantees that you have handled each case of the `Path.State` enum,
which can be nice for when you add new types of destinations to the stack.

In each of these cases you can return any kind of view that you want, but ultimately you want to
make use of the library's `CaseLet` view in order to scope down to a specific case of the
`Path.State` enum:

```swift
} destination: { state in
  switch state {
  case .addItem:
    CaseLet(
      state: /RootFeature.Path.State.addItem,
      action: RootFeature.Path.Action.addItem,
      then: AddView.init(store:)
    )
  case .detailItem:
    CaseLet(
      state: /RootFeature.Path.State.detailItem,
      action: RootFeature.Path.Action.detailItem,
      then: DetailView.init(store:)
    )
  case .editItem:
    CaseLet(
      state: /RootFeature.Path.State.editItem,
      action: RootFeature.Path.Action.editItem,
      then: EditView.init(store:)
    )
  }
}
```

And that is all it takes to integrate multiple child features together into a navigation stack, and
done so with concisely modeled domains. Once those steps are taken you can easily add additional
features to the stack by adding a new case to the `Path` reducer state and action enums, and you get
complete introspection into what is happening in each child feature from the parent. Read our
article on ["integration in stack-based navigation"][stack-integration-article] for more information
on that.
