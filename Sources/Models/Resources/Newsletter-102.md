Last week we hosted our first ever livestream. In an hour and a half we discussed some of the tools
that our [Dependencies](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies) library comes with that we
didn't have time to discuss in episodes, and we live refactored our open-source
[Standups](http://github.com/pointfreeco/standups) application to use iOS 16's new
`NavigationStack`. We also answered 18 viewer questions, and just have 94 more left in the queue. ðŸ˜…

We are now [hosting that recorded livestream](/episodes/ep221-point-free-live-dependencies-stacks)
on our site, and it is available free for everyone to watch. We have taken the time to clean things
up a bit and make it more digestible for viewing in a non-live manner, including:

  * **1080p video**: The event was streamed live at 720p, but the recorded version can be
    watched at 1080p.
  * **Chapter markers:** Most of the big, important topics of the livestream have been
    made available and you can start the video at any chapter.
  * **Fully searchable transcript:** We cleaned up a machine-generated transcript by hand,
    complete with speaker annotations and timestamps.
  * **Question & answers:** All questions and answers have been pulled out into their
    [own section](/episodes/ep221-point-free-live-dependencies-stacks#questions-and-answers),
    with timestamps. If you couldn't stay for the whole livestream your question may have been
    answered!
