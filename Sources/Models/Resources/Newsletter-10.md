We're happy to announce that we now offer a 50% discount on personal subscriptions for students that
are currently enrolled in a university or coding school. All you have to do is
[email us](mailto:support@pointfree.co?subject=Student%20Discount) proof of your enrollment, such as
a scanned photo of your student ID or a proof of enrollment from the organization, and we'll give
you a discount code that can be used on the [personal](/pricing) subscription plan, both monthly and
yearly.

Some may think that our material isn't exactly beginner friendly, and although there is some truth
to that, we also believe that the ideas of functional programming are best introduced during the
formative period of one's life in programming. Most introductory education materials put too much of
an emphasis on getting things up on a screen and too little time on the fundamentals of where
complexity lies in our applications and what tools help control it.

Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@pointfree.co?subject=Student%20Discount) to us if you
have any questions!
