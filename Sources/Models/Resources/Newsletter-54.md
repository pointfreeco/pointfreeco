**isowords** is a word search game on a vanishing cube. Connect letters on the cube to form words,
the longer the better, and the third time a letter is used its cube is removed, revealing letters
inside!

  - Spell words by connecting letters on a 3-dimensional cube
  - The longer the word, the more points you earn!
  - Use each face wisely! Once you use a letter 3 times its cube will disappear, revealing more letters underneath.
  - THREE GAME MODES: timed, unlimited, and multiplayer!
  - DAILY CHALLENGE: everyone in the world plays the same puzzles.
  - Global leaderboards show how you stack up against everyone in the world.

### Multiplayer mode
