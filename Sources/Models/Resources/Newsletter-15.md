Last week we concluded our 3-part introductory series on the `zip` function
([part 1](/episodes/ep23-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-1), [part 2](/episodes/ep24-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-2),
[part 3](/episodes/ep25-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-3)). In that series we showed that `zip` goes far beyond
what the Swift standard library gives us on sequences, and in fact it generalizes the notion of `map`
on N-ary functions. This means we can feel empowered to define `zip` on our own types, even though we don't
typically think of our types in that way, and it allows reuse to use the same "shapes" in our code across
wildly different contexts.

To celebrate the completion of that somewhat intense series of episodes, we are happy to release version 0.3.0
of our [Swift Overture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-overture) library, now with a _whole bunch_ of zips!

## N-ary zip for Sequences

The Swift standard library defines [`zip`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1541125-zip) to take a pair of sequences. While the Swift "Generics Manifesto" [shows an example](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/478d846e3699a48bca8867d82086ecaaec9c80e3/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#variadic-generics) of how Swift may support a `zip` of any number of sequences, why wait?

Overture 0.3.0 defines `zip` to zip up to ten sequences at once! This means supporting the ability to easily combine related sequences that may have come from different sources.

```swift
let ids = [1, 2, 3]
let emails = [
  "blob@pointfree.co",
  "blob.jr@pointfree.co",
  "blob.sr@pointfree.co"
]
let names = ["Blob", "Blob Junior", "Blob Senior"]

zip(ids, emails, names)
// [
//   (1, "blob@pointfree.co", "Blob"),
//   (2, "blob.jr@pointfree.co", "Blob Junior"),
//   (3, "blob.sr@pointfree.co", "Blob Senior")
// ]
```

When combined with `map`, we have a succinct way of transforming tuples into other values!

```swift
struct User {
  let id: Int
  let email: String
  let name: String
}

zip(ids, emails, names).map(User.init)
// [
//   User(
//     id: 1, email: "blob@pointfree.co", name: "Blob"
//   ),
//   User(
//     id: 2, email: "blob.jr@pointfree.co", name: "Blob Junior"
//   ),
//   User(
//     id: 3, email: "blob.sr@pointfree.co", name: "Blob Senior"
//   )
// ]
```

Overture also provides a `zip(with:)` function, for ergonomics and composition.

```swift
zip(with: User.init)(ids, emails, names)
// [
//   User(
//     id: 1, email: "blob@pointfree.co", name: "Blob"
//   ),
//   User(
//     id: 2, email: "blob.jr@pointfree.co", name: "Blob Junior"
//   ),
//   User(
//     id: 3, email: "blob.sr@pointfree.co", name: "Blob Senior"
//   )
// ]
```

## Zip for Optionals

Overture also defines `zip` for optional values. This is an expressive way of unwrapping a bunch of
values at once, much like multiple `if`/`guard`â€“`let` binding.

```swift
let optionalId: Int? = 1
let optionalEmail: String? = "blob@pointfree.co"
let optionalName: String? = "Blob"

zip(optionalId, optionalEmail, optionalName)
// Optional<(Int, String, String)>.some(
//   (1, "blob@pointfree.co", "Blob")
// )
```

As we saw with `Sequence`, `zip` pairs well with `map`, and we already have `map` on `Optional`!

```swift
zip(optionalId, optionalEmail, optionalName).map(User.init)
// Optional<User>.some(
//   User(id: 1, email: "blob@pointfree.co", name: "Blob")
// )
```

We once again have `zip(with:)` at our disposal, for ergonomics and composition.

```swift
zip(with: User.init)(optionalId, optionalEmail, optionalName)
// Optional<User>.some(
//   User(id: 1, email: "blob@pointfree.co", name: "Blob")
// )
```

Using `zip` can be an expressive alternative to `let`-unwrapping!

```swift
let optionalUser = zip(with: User.init)(
  optionalId, optionalEmail, optionalName
)

// vs.

let optionalUser: User?
if let id = optionalId,
  let email = optionalEmail,
  let name = optionalName
{
  optionalUser = User(id: id, email: email, name: name)
} else {
  optionalUser = nil
}
```
