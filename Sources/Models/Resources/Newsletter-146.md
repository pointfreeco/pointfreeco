One of the more exciting announcements from this year's WWDC was the introduction of a native
Swift testing framework. It is built entirely in Swift, will be able to integrate into a 
variety of IDEs, not just Xcode, and comes with a suite of powerful testing tools.

We are excited to announce that our popular [SnapshotTesting][snapshot-gh] library has been updated
([version 1.17.0][snapshot-1.17]) to support the new Swift Testing framework, as well as our 
[MacroTesting][macro-testing-gh] library, and we've even introduced a few new features along the 
way.

## Beta preview for Swift Testing support

> Note: Currently our support of the Swift Testing framework is considered "beta" 
> because Swift's own testing framework has not even officially been released yet. Once it is 
> officially released, probably sometime in September, we will have an official release of our 
> libraries with support.

The Apple ecosystem currently has two primary testing frameworks, and unfortunately they are not
compatible with each other. There is the XCTest framework, which has been around for decades and
is a private framework provided by Apple and heavily integrated into Xcode. And now there is 
[Swift Testing](http://github.com/apple/swift-testing), an open source testing ramework built in 
Swift that is capable of integrating into a variety of environments.

These two frameworks are not compatible in the sense that an assertion made in one framework
from a test in the other framework will not trigger a test failure. So, if you are writing a test
with the new `@Test` macro style, and you use a test helper that ultimately calls `XCTFail` under
the hood, that will not bubble up to an actual test failure when tests are run. And similarly, if
you have a test case inheriting from `XCTestCase` that ultimiately invokes the new style `#expect`
macro, that too will not actually trigger a test failure.

However, these details have all been hidden away in our SnapshotTesting library. You can simply
use `assertSnapshot` in either an `XCTestCase` subclass _or_ `@Test`, and it will dynamically 
detect what context it is running in and trigger the correct test failure:

```swift
class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
  func testFeature() {
    assertSnapshot(of: MyView(), as: .image)  // âœ…
  }
}

@Test 
func testFeature() {
  assertSnapshot(of: MyView(), as: .image)  // âœ…
}
```

For the most part, asserting on snapshots works the same whether you are using XCTest or Swift
Testing. There is one major difference, and that is how snapshot configuration works. There are
two major ways snapshots can be configured: `diffTool` and `record`. 

The `diffTool` property allows you to customize how a command is printed to the test failure
message that allows you to quickly open a diff of two files, such as
[Kaleidoscope](http://kaleidoscope.app). The `record` property allows you to change the mode of
assertion so that new snapshots are generated and saved to disk.

These properties can be overridden for a scope of an operation using the `withSnapshotTesting` 
function. In an XCTest context the simplest way to do this is to override the `invokeTest` method 
on `XCTestCase` and wrap it in `withSnapshotTesting`:

```swift
class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
  override func invokeTest() {
    withSnapshotTesting(
      record: .missing,
      diffTool: .ksdiff 
    ) {
      super.invokeTest()
    }
  }
}
```

This will override the `diffTool` and `record` properties for each test function.

Swift's new testing framework does not currently have a public API for this kind of customization.
There is an experimental feature, called `CustomExecutionTrait`, that does gives us this ability,
and the library provides such a trait called `.snapshots(diffTool:record:)`. It can
be attached to any `@Test` or `@Suite` to configure snapshot testing:

```swift
@_spi(Experimental) import SnapshotTesting

@Suite(.snapshots(record: .all, diffTool: .ksdiff))
struct FeatureTests {
  â€¦
}
```

> Important: As evident by the usage of `@_spi(Experimental)` this API is subject to change. As
> soon as the Swift Testing library finalizes its API for `CustomExecutionTrait` we will update
> the library accordingly and remove the `@_spi` annotation.

Now all tests run in the suite will be recorded in the `.all` and test failures will be printed
with the `ksdiff` command line tool.

## New features in SnapshotTesting

Alongside support for Swift Testing we have also introduced a few new features.  Currently there 
are two global variables in the library for customizing snapshot testing:

  * ``isRecording`` determines whether new snapshots are generated and saved to disk when the test
    runs.

  * ``diffTool`` determines the command line tool that is used to inspect the diff of two files on
    disk.

These customization options have a few downsides currently. 

  * First, because they are globals they can easily bleed over from test to test in unexpected ways.
    And further, Swift's new testing library runs parallel tests in the same process, which is in
    stark contrast to XCTest, which runs parallel tests in separate processes. This means there are
    even more chances for these globals to bleed from one test to another.

  * And second, these options aren't as granular as some of our users wanted. When ``isRecording``
    is true snapshots are generated and written to disk, and when it is false snapshots are not 
    generated, _unless_ a file is not present on disk. The a snapshot _is_ generated. Some of our
    users wanted an option between these two extremes, where snapshots would not be generated if the
    file does not exist on disk.

    And the ``diffTool`` variable allows one to specify a command line tool to use for visualizing
    diffs of files, but only works when the command line tool accepts a very narrow set of 
    arguments,  _e.g.:

    ```sh
    ksdiff /path/to/file1.png /path/to/file2.png
    ```

Because of these reasons, the globals ``isRecording`` and ``diffTool`` are now deprecated, and we
have introduced a new tool that greatly improves upon all of these problems. There is now a function
called `withSnapshotTesting` for customizing snapshots. It allows you to customize how 
the `assertSnapshot` tool behaves for a well-defined scope.

Rather than overriding `isRecording` or `diffTool` directly in your tests, you can wrap your test in
`withSnapshotTesting`:

```swift
// Before
func testFeature() {
  isRecording = true 
  diffTool = "ksdiff"
  assertSnapshot(â€¦)
}

// After
func testFeature() {
  withSnapshotTesting(record: .all, diffTool: .ksdiff) {
    assertSnapshot(â€¦)
  }
}
```

If you want to override the options for an entire test class, you can override the `invokeTest`
method of `XCTestCase`:

```swift
// Before
class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
  override func invokeTest() {
    isRecording = true 
    diffTool = "ksdiff"
    defer { 
      isRecording = false
      diffTool = nil
    }
    super.invokeTest()
  }
}

// After
class FeatureTests: XCTestCase {
  override func invokeTest() {
    withSnapshotTesting(record: .all, diffTool: .ksdiff) {
      super.invokeTest()
    }
  }
}
```

And if you want to override these settings for _all_ tests, then you can implement a base
`XCTestCase` subclass and have your tests inherit from it.

Further, the `diffTool` and `record` arguments have extra customization capabilities:

  * `diffTool` is now a function 
    `(String, String) -> String` that is handed the current snapshot file and the failed snapshot
    file. It can return the command that one can run to display a diff. For example, to use
    ImageMagick's `compare` command and open the result in Preview.app:

    ```swift
    extension SnapshotTestingConfiguration.DiffTool {
      static let compare = Self { 
        "compare \"\($0)\" \"\($1)\" png: | open -f -a Preview.app" 
      }
    }
    ```

  * `record` is now a type with 4
    choices: `all`, `missing`, `never`, `failed`:
    * `all`: All snapshots will be generated and saved to disk. 
    * `missing`: only the snapshots that are missing from the disk will be generated
    and saved. 
    * `never`: No snapshots will be generated, even if they are missing. This option is appropriate
    when running tests on CI so that re-tries of tests do not surprisingly pass after snapshots are
    unexpectedly generated.
    * `failed`: Snapshots only for failing tests will be generated. This can be useful for tests
    that use precision thresholds so that passing tests do not re-record snapshots that are 
    subtly different but still within the threshold.

## MacroTesting updates

And SnapshotTesting is not the only library getting updates for Swift Testing. Our macro testing
library, aptly named [MacroTesting][macro-testing-gh], has also been updated to support the new
testing framework. You can now use the `assertMacro` helper in both XCTest and Swift Testing
contexts in order to assert how your macros expand and emit diagnostics: 

```swift
@Test
func expansionWithMalformedURLEmitsError() {
  assertMacro {
    """
    let invalid = #URL("https://not a url.com")
    """
  } diagnostics: {
    """
    let invalid = #URL("https://not a url.com")
                  â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
                  â•°â”€ ðŸ›‘ malformed url: "https://not a url.com"
    """
  }
}
```
