The Composable Architecture is now 4 years old! We released version 0.1.0 of the library on
[May 4th, 2020][tca-0.1-blog], and since then have had **191** contributors, 
**116** releases, **1,270** pull requests, **57,000** [Slack messages][slack-invite] and more than 
**1,200** GitHub discussions.

In the past 4 years we have had many big updates to the library, making sure to support each new
major feature in Swift and SwiftUI, and do so in backwards compatible ways, including:

* Async effects ([0.39.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.39.0))
* Reducer protocol and builders ([0.41.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.41.0))
* Non-exhaustive test stores ([0.45.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.45.0))
* Navigation tools ([0.54.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.54.0))
* Reliable async testing ([0.56.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.56.0))
* Official 1.0 release ([1.0.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/1.0.0))
* Macros ([1.4.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/1.4.0))
* Observation tools ([1.7.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/1.7.0))
* Shared state ([1.10.0](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/1.10.0))

And even for those that cannot or do not want to use the Composable Architecture, we have split out
multiple standalone libraries from it:

* [swift-clocks](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-clocks)
* [swift-case-paths](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths)
* [swift-perception](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-perception)
* [swiftui-navigation](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation)
* [swift-custom-dump](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-custom-dump)
* [swift-dependencies](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)
* [swift-macro-testing](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-macro-testing)
* [combine-schedulers](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/combine-schedulers)
* [xctest-dynamic-overlay](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/xctest-dynamic-overlay)
* [swift-concurrency-extras](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-concurrency-extras)
* [swift-identified-collections](https://www.github.com/pointfreeco/swift-identified-collections)

We feel that these libraries can be helpful building any kind of application, whether you are using
the Composable Architecture or not. They help you develop features that are concise and testable.

## App architecture live stream

To celebrate this new milestone, we are hosting a live stream to discuss all things app 
architecture. Have a question about the Composable Architecture? Want to know how it compares to 
other styles of building apps? Or just want to discuss the philosophy of app architecture in 
general? Well, we have the live stream for you!

The Q&A is already open so you can ask questions and upvote any existing questions:
