Once subscribed you'll get instant access to 
all 262 episodes (and growing) of Point-Free, including popular collections that have grown 
this past year:

- **[Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui-collection]**: What does it take to build a complex application in
SwiftUI using modern techniques? We rebuild one of Apple's popular demo apps from scratch, but with
a focus on domain modeling, controlling side effects and dependencies, navigation and testing.

- **[Advanced concurrency][concurrency-collection]**: Want to learn about advanced Swift concurrency topics
that aren't covered anywhere else? Well, we've got your covered. We have a deep dive into 
concurrency on Apple's platforms from past to present and through to the future, we cover time-based
asynchrony including how to control time, and we've got the definitive guide to making async code
testable.

- **[@Observable][observation-collection]**: Swift 5.9 came with a powerful observation framework
and it completely revolutionized the way one creates views in SwiftUI. Learn everything you need
to know about observation in our [series][observation-collection], including how to avoid its most
common pitfalls.

- **[Testing & debugging macros][testing-debugging-macros]**: Macros are the biggest feature to 
come to Swift since concurrency tools, but they can be difficult to get right. You need to know how
to debug and test your macros, which is why we dedicated 2 whole episodes to the topic.   

That's a very brief recap of our 2023 (see more [here][eoy-2023]), and we have even bigger
plans for 2024! [Click here][eoy-discount]üéÅ to redeem the coupon code now. The offer will
