We have been running [Point-Free](/), a video series covering original and advanced Swift programming topics, for 8 years! During that time we have released dozens of open-source projects that are collectively cloned hundreds of thousands of times a week. We respond to thousands of comments spread across our GitHub repos, [Slack community](/slack-invite), and [social media](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco) accounts. And we continue to push the Swift ecosystem in the direction that we think helps simplify and untangle complex apps, such as a focus on embracing value types, proper domain modeling, as well as a push to build a SwiftData replacement that embraces modern best practices.

And we are now excited to announce an upcoming [live stream](/live), as well as a new way for Point-Free subscribers to embrace the patterns and concepts we have championed for over 8 years.

## The Point-Free Way

Today we are releasing a beta preview of what we call the "[Point-Free Way](/the-way)". It is a collection of AI skill documents that can be used with any popular AI tooling (Claude, Codex, etc.). It encodes all of the principles we have espoused over the years, as well as all of the best practices for using our libraries.

And the best part is that they will be constantly updated. Every time we answer a question in one of our many forums, or see an anti-pattern emerge within the community, we will update skill documents to help guide people towards the right path.

> Important: Beta invites are now closed, but we will be releasing the tools soon!

We will be releasing the first stable version of these tools in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!

## Live stream

We are also excited to announce that we are hosting a [live stream](/live) next week on February 5th, at 9am PST / 5pm GMT. In this live stream, we will give a preview of how the "Point-Free Way" works by building two demos from scratch, allowing us to demonstrate how to get AI tooling to write the best possible code when using our libraries. We will also be giving a sneak peek of the next generation of the [Composable Architecture](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and we will give away a few free subscriptions!

## Here's to another 8 years of Point-Free!

We have no intention of stopping anytime soon, and we are eternally grateful to our [subscribers](/pricing) that support us to keep developing videos, open source libraries, and tools for the community!
