Six years ago, to the _day_, we launched Point-Free with a pair of episodes
([functions][functions-ep] and [side-effects][side-effects-ep]), and since
then have released 266 episodes, 167 hours of video, and have had millions of views.

To celebrate, we have [released][1.7-release] one of the most important updates to the
[Composable Architecture][tca-gh] since its inception, and we are announcing a live stream for
next week:

[tca-gh]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture
[1.7-release]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/1.7.0
[functions-ep]: /episodes/ep1-functions
[side-effects-ep]: /episodes/ep2-side-effects

@Button(/live) {
  Watch Feb 5 @ 9am PST / 5pm GMT
}

> Correction: Due to severe weather and power outages in California the livestream has been delayed
until later in the week. Stay tuned!

We will be discussing the latest release of the Composable Architecture, but we will also unveil a
surprise release of the library bringing all new super powers to the `@Reducer` macro, _and_ we
will announce a new beta for the library that solves one of the most frequent problems people ask
about when using the library.

And of course we will have plenty of time to take questions from our viewers.
[Last livestream][pf-live-ep] we answered 18 questions out of 112, and so hopefully we will get
to even more this time!

## To 6 more years!

We are eternally grateful to all of our subscribers, who make it possible for us to create
our episodes and work on open source projects. We wouldn't be here without you. Here's
to six more years! ðŸ¥³
