It's Cyber Monday and our [rare holiday sale](/discounts/black-friday-2024) is almost over!

Subscribe today and gain instant access to hours of content covering advanced Swift topics,
including:

  * Dependencies: Learn what dependencies are and how they can make code difficult to exercise in
    the simulator, previews, and tests. And learn how to control them effectively.

  * Persistence: Persisting application state is a common problem that is surprisingly complex. We
    dive deep into the topic from `@AppStorage` to SQLite.
    
  * Deep dives into basics: Learn more than you ever though there was to know about the `Equatable`
    and `Hashable` protocols, and other seemingly simple topics.

And so much more!
