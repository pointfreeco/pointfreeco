This week we had to cancel our livestream due to historic rain in California and the resulting
power outages. But things are settled, and we're ready to go live again!

The livestream is now planned for February 12th at 9am PST and 5pm GMT.

We will be discussing the latest release of the Composable Architecture, but we will also unveil a
surprise release of the library bringing all new super powers to the `@Reducer` macro, _and_ we
will give a sneak peek at a brand new feature coming to the library that solves one of the most 
frequent problems people ask about when using the library.
