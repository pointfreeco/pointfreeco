You will get instant access to hundreds of hours of content covering advanced Swift topics, 
including:

  * Modern persistence: Use SQLite to the best of its abilities to provide a modern foundation
    of persistence for your app, including synchronization across many devices and data sharing.
  
  * Concurrency: There's a lot of misunderstanding in the community about Swift's concurrency tools,
    and we'd like to take the time to clear the fog and show where these tools truly excel.
    
  * Architecture: What _is_ "architecture" and what problems does it solve? We approach things from
    first principles to develop an application architecture from scratch.

  * Cross-platform Swift: Take all of your Swift skills and apply them outside the iOS and macOS
    ecosystems, including the server and even the browser!

And so much more!
