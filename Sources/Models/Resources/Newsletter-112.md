After more than 3 years of development, 145 contributors, and 983 closed pull requests, the
[Composable Architecture][tca-gh] has finally reached 1.0! ðŸŽ‰

The library has been quite stable since its inception, but we weren't ready to put the "1.0" label 
on it until we released its [navigation tools][nav-tools-blog], which happened just a few weeks ago.
If you want to get started with the library today you have two options:

  * This week we are beginning to release a [brand new series of episodes][1.0-tour] to tour the 1.0
    library. The first episode builds a simple application from scratch to demonstrate how to
    implement your first feature, execute side effects, control dependencies, and write a full test
    suite.

    Next week the tour continues by rebuilding Apple's [Scrumdinger][scrumdinger] from scratch,
    using the Composable Architecture. This involves composing together many isolated features,
    exploring navigation patterns, dealing with complex side-effects, and writing tests to exercise
    all of the subtle and nuanced logic in the application.

  * The documentation has a [full tutorial][tutorial] that explores all of the fundamentals of 
    building a feature in the Composable Architecture. This includes implementing the core logic and
    behavior of your features with reducers, controlling dependencies, writing tests, and using the 
    library's navigation tools.

## Upgrading to 1.0

In tandem with the 1.0 release we are also releasing [0.57.0][0.57.0-release], which is a
backwards-compatible release that hard deprecates everything that is removed in 1.0. This provides
you a soft landing for upgrading your projects. We recommend you first upgrade to 0.57.0, fix all
deprecation warnings, and _then_ upgrade to 1.0 and fix any compiler errors for incompatible changes
we made to the library.

## The future

This is only the beginning for the Composable Architecture. We have [big plans][tca-edge-tweets]
to integrate all of the new features of Swift 5.9 and iOS 17 into the library, such as the  
`Observable` protocol and macros. These tools will fundamentally change the ergonomics and power of
the library, but as always we will aim to make these additions as backwards compatible as possible.

## Update today

If you use the Composable Architecture, then we highly recommend upgrading to 1.0 as soon as 
possible. And if you do not use the Composable Architecture, then there's no time like the 
present. ðŸ¥³
