          We begin our exploration of application architecture by understanding the core problems that any architecture aims to solve, and we will explore these problems by seeing how SwiftUI approaches state management. This will lead us to formulating the 5 big problems that must be solved, and will guide the development of our architecture from this point forward:

          * How to manage state across an entire application
          * How to model the architecture with simple units, such as value types
          * How to modularize each feature of the application

We achieve both of these goals with reducers, while delegating the messy runtime of our application to a unit known as a "store."

              In this section we showed how to "pullback" reducers along key paths of state and actions. However, the pullback for actions didn't seem quite right, primarily because it required code generation to get right. It turns out that our mistake was using key paths for actions, when there is a more appropriate tool to use that we call a "case path." The following episodes introduce case paths from first principles, and then show how to refactor the Composable Architecture to take advantage of them.
