Enums are one of Swift's most notable, powerful features, and as Swift developers we love them and are lucky to have them! By contrasting them with their more familiar counterpart, structs, we can learn interesting things about them, unlocking ergonomics and functionality that the Swift language could learn from.

Although structs and enums have first class treatment in Swift and are awesome to use, structs tend to have nicer ergonomics than enums. We will explore what it would look like for enums to get many of the affordances that structs have.

We've now seen how we can take a feature of structs, properties in particular, explore the equivalent API on enums, and find benefits, like more ergonomic data access. It's time to take things to the next level by taking another, related feature of structs, key paths, and make a case for the enum equivalent.

          blurb: #"""
Key paths are an incredibly powerful feature of the Swift language: they are compiler-generated bundles of getter-setter pairs and are automatically made available for every struct property. So what happens when we theorize an equivalent feature for every enum case?

Next we will explore a real-world use for case paths: SwiftUI and the `Binding` type. Bindings are the fundamental unit that connects your data model to your UI, but one of its core operators for transformation rely on key paths, thus restricting our domain modeling to structs. We will fix this disparity by beefing up the `Binding` type with support for case paths.

One of the fundamental units of SwiftUI state management is the `Binding` type, which connects your data model to your UI. It even comes with composable, transformable operations that make it really nice to use...with structs. Enums, unfortunately, are completely left out of the equation, which can lead us to model our domains in less than ideal ways. We will dissect the problem and build the tools that Apple leaves out of the framework.
