The Combine framework puts a powerful, reactive programming library in the hands of every person developing for Apple's platforms. We cover some of the framework's most foundational and mysterious aspects from first principles so that you can wield its power without getting lost in the zoo of types and operators.

We provided a short, succinct, two part introduction to the basics of Combine so that we could leverage Combine to power the effects in the Composable Architecture. We discuss Combine's core concepts, such as publishers and subscribers, from first principles and show how they compare to concepts we've covered previously on Point-Free.

We developed our own custom reactive type from first principles to model effects in the Composable Architecture, which we then later refactored to take advantage of Combine.

There's a lot of great material in the community covering almost every aspect of the Combine framework, but sadly Combine's `Scheduler` protocol hasn't gotten much attention. It's a pretty mysterious protocol, and Apple does not provide much documentation about it, but it is incredibly powerful and can allow one to test how time flows through complex publishers.

Combine schedulers turn out to be the perfect tool for animating asynchronous effects. In this series of episodes we introduce an "animated" scheduler that solves a real problem in the Composable Architecture _and_ improves the ergonomics of scheduling animations in vanilla SwiftUI.
