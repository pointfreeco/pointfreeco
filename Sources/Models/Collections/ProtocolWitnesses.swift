Protocols are great! We love them, you probably love them, and Apple certainly loves them! However, they aren't without their drawbacks. There are many times that using protocols can become cumbersome, such as when using associated types, and there are some things that are just impossible to do using protocols. We will explore some alternatives to protocols that allow us to solve some of these problems, and open up whole new worlds of composability that were previously impossible to see.

Protocols are powerful for abstraction, but they aren't the only way to abstract. Turns out that nearly every protocol in Swift can be mechanically transformed into a simple concrete data type. In doing so you can accomplish things that are currently impossible with Swift's protocols, and you can unlock new forms of composition that are impossible to see with protocols.

Now that we understand the drawbacks of and alternatives to protocols, it's time to apply this knowledge to a real-world use case. We will develop a snapshot testing library from first principles using protocol-oriented programming and demonstrate the problems that come with this approach. Then we will scrap the protocols, use simple concrete data types, and discover a whole new world of composition.

Protocol-oriented programming was first coined by Apple at the 2012 WWDC, and since then it has become the de facto way to create abstractions in Swift. But, as we've seen, they have some gotchas. In this section we will build a library from first principles inspired by protocol-oriented programming, and clearly show the downsides to this approach. Then, we'll scrap the protocols, use simple concrete data types, and discover a whole new world of composition.
