Parsing is a surprisingly ubiquitous problem in programming. Every time we construct an integer or a URL from a string, we are technically doing parsing. After demonstrating the many types of parsing that Apple gives us access to, we will take a step back and define the essence of parsing in a single type. That type supports many wonderful types of compositions, and allows us to break large, complex parsing problems into small, understandable units.

Parsing is a difficult, but surprisingly ubiquitous programming problem, and functional programming has a lot to say about it. Let's take a moment to understand the problem space of parsing, and see what tools Swift and Apple gives us to parse complex text formats.

Now that we've distilled parsing into a core, functional unit, it's time to explore its transformable, composable properties. We'll leverage [earlier learnings](/collections/map-zip-flat-map) by asking ourselves if parsers have a `map` operation, and if they have a `zip` operation, and if they have a `flatMap` operation.

We'll define the functional trio of operations on the `Parser` type: `map`, `zip` and `flatMap`. They introduce a familiar means of transforming and combining simple parsers into more and more complex parsers that can extract out first class data from nebulous blobs of data.

The `Parser` type isn't the only type that supports `map`, `zip` and `flatMap` operations. There are many types that can be transformed in similar ways, and even the Swift standard library and Apple frameworks ship with many examples. This collection of episodes explores this topic deeply, and hopes to empower you to define these operations on your own types as well.

Now that we've seen that parsers have `map`, `zip`, and `flatMap` operations, it's time to take things to the next level and explore a whole bunch of what are commonly called "parser combinators": or "higher-order" functions that enhance and combine parsers in more and more interesting, complex ways.

Parsing is just one of many problems functional programming solves by defining a core, composable, transformable unit. We apply these exact same techniques to randomness and even architecture!
