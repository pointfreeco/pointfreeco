It's easy to write code and be completely unaware of how ubiquitous "parsing" is or how often we turn to parsers for many of our everyday tasks. We'll define what "parsing" is generally, see what functional programming has to say about it, and uncover a wonderful story of composition along the way.

Parsing is a difficult, but surprisingly ubiquitous programming problem, and functional programming has a lot to say about it. Let's take a moment to understand the problem space of parsing, and see what tools Swift and Apple gives us to parse complex text formats.

Now that we've distilled parsing into a core, functional unit, it's time to explore its transformable, composable properties. We'll leverage [earlier learnings](/collections/map-zip-flat-map) by asking ourselves if parsers have a `map` operation, and if they have a `zip` operation, and if they have a `flatMap` operation.

We'll define the trio of operations that form the basis of our functional programming toolkit on the `Parser` type. They introduce a familiar means of transforming and combining more basic parsers into more and more complex parsers that can pluck data out of some seriously complicated formats.

We go much deeper exploring `map`, `zip`, and `flatMap` in this collection of episodes. Parsers aren't alone! These operations are defined on a bunch of types in the Swift standard library and other Apple frameworks, and you should be empowered to define them on your own types as well.

Now that we've seen that parsers have `map`, `zip`, and `flatMap` operations, it's time to take things to the next level and explore a whole bunch of what are commonly called "parser combinators": or "higher-order" functions that enhance and combine parsers in more and more interesting, complex ways.
