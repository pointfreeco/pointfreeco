After taking a high-level view of the tools SwiftUI provides for building applications, let's take a low-level view of one of its fundamental units: the Binding type. Bindings are crucial for providing communication between your data model and your views, and even come with some composable, transformable operations! We'll examine this tool with a bit more scrutiny to identify where it falls short and how we can improve it.

One of the fundamental units of SwiftUI state management is the Binding type, which connects your data model to your UI. It even comes with composable, transformable operations that make it really nice to use...with structs. Enums, unfortunately, are completely left out of the equation, which can lead us to model our domains in less than ideal ways. We will dissect the problem and build the tools that Apple leaves out of the framework.

The `Binding` type is just one of many examples of Swift and its frameworks providing special treatment to structs while leaving enums behind, but structs are no more important than enums. In fact they are two sides of the same coin, both equally important in their own way. In this collection we explore more of these disparities and attempt to bridge the gaps.

Our search for a transformation operator on `Binding` is nothing new for Point-Free. We are _always_ on the lookout for ways to transform generic types into all new generic types because it unlocks all new capabilities from the type. We explore this concept in-depth in our collection discussing the many ways that `map`, `zip` and `flatMap` appear naturally in the code we write everyday.

Next we will explore another SwiftUI API: ”redacted views.” SwiftUI makes it easy to redact the contents of a view, but unfortunately has less to say about redacting its logic.

SwiftUI has introduced the concept of “redacted views”, which gives you a really nice way to redact the a view's content. This is really powerful, but just because the view has been redacted it doesn’t mean the logic has been. We will demonstrate this problem and show how the Composable Architecture offers a really nice solution.
