We currently offer two ways of obtaining a Point-Free subscription at a discount: currently enrolled [students](/blog/posts/10-announcing-student-discounts) can get 50% off their subscription, and people living in certain [regions](/blog/posts/42-regional-discounts) can get 50% off to help make up for currency discrepencies between the United States and other countries.

We would like to extend this further by offering free, lifetime subscriptions to Point-Free to any current or past student of certain orginizations that focus on training and education of BIPOC. If you are such a person and are intersted in gaining access to Point-Free, please [email us](mailto:support@pointfree.co) with proof of enrollment and we'll get you set up right away!
