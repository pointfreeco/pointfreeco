We do this only a few times a year: we're having a [rare, one-day Point-Free sale](/discounts/cyber-monday-2021) this Cyber Monday by offering 30% off the first year of your subscription!

Once subscribed you'll get instant access to all 169 episodes (96 hours of video and growing!) of Point-Free content, including popular collections that were created or expanded this past year:

### [SwiftUI Navigation](/collections/swiftui/navigation)

Navigation is a really, _really_ complex topic, and it took us 9 episodes (and nearly 6 hours!) to build up the concepts from first principles. Along the way we wrote a powerful set of tools that allow one to model their domains in the most concise way possible while still making it ergonomic and simple to use SwiftUI's navigation APIs. We even open sourced a [library](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation) from the content of these episodes!

### [Dependencies](/collections/dependencies)

Dependencies can wreak havoc on a codebase, and that's why it's important to understand what a dependency is and the best way to control it. We devoted an entire [series](/collections/dependencies/designing-dependencies) of episodes to defining dependencies and showing how to control them. And then another whole [series](/collections/dependencies/better-test-dependencies) on how to make tests stronger and more exhaustive by using better designed test dependencies.

### [Tour of isowords](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/tours/isowords)

We spend a lot of time talking about software best practices, but we also practice what we preach. To demonstrate this we open sourced an entire application (a game no less!) to show how to build a large project in SwiftUI, using the [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), with a full test suite, in a modern and modular Xcode project style, and more.

### [WWDC 2021](/collections/wwdc)

We devoted a series of episodes to exploring some of the cool features announced at WWDC this year, including [.refreshable](/collections/wwdc/wwdc-2021/ep153-async-refreshable-swiftui),  [@FocusState](/collections/wwdc/wwdc-2021/ep155-swiftui-focus-state), and [.searchable](/collections/wwdc/wwdc-2021/ep156-searchable-swiftui-part-1). We first explore these APIs from first principles, and then apply them to the [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

### [SwiftUI Animation](/collections/swiftui/animations)

Animation is one of the most impressive features of SwiftUI, but the APIs can be quite mysterious. Our series of episodes shows how each API can be used and builds a tool for "animating" Combine schedulers, which has amazing applications for vanilla SwiftUI _and_ [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) applications.

## Subscribe today!

We have plenty of exciting topics planned for 2022, including all new episodes on parsing (improving ergonomics, "reversible" parsing, applications to iOS routing, and _more_), navigation in the [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), deep explorations into Swift concurrency, and more!
