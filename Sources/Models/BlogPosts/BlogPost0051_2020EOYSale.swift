Weâ€™re happy to announce [an end-of-year sale](/discounts/2020-is-over) by offering 25% off the first year of your subscription!

Once subscribed you'll get instant access to all 130 episodes (and growing) of Point-Free, including popular collections that have grown this past year:

- [Composable Architecture](/collections/composable-architecture): We started developing the Composable Architecture from first principles after breaking down the problems app architecture should solve, all the way back in July 2019. We continued to refine things over _17 hours_ (so far) in this collection of episodes, while covering aspects of SwiftUI, Combine, and more general concepts like testing and dependencies! We finally bundled things up into [an open source library](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) so that you can immediately put these concepts to use in your applications!

- [Parsing](/collections/parsing): When we define "parsing" as transforming some kind of unstructured data into something more structured, it turns out that parsing is quite a ubiquitous problem that shows up in a lot of the everyday code we write! It also turns out that functional programming has a lot to say about parsing. We first started covering the topic last year, but many viewers have requested more content, and we made some truly impressive progress, showing how parsers [generalize](/collections/parsing/generalization), and how composed parsers can be [as performant](/collections/parsing/performance) as highly-tuned, more ad-hoc hand-written parsers. We even ended the year with our first release of [Parsing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing), a production ready library that bundles up everything we've covered so far and more.

- [Dependencies](/collection/dependencies): We tackled dependencies head on in this 5-part series where we precisely describe what dependencies are and why the make our code complex, and then show what to do about it. We build a moderately complex application from scratch, one that uses API requests, network connectivity APIs, and location manager APIs, and show how to wrangle those dependencies into something simple, flexible, and testable.

In addition to these topics, we covered:

- [SwiftUI bindings](/episodes/ep107-composable-swiftui-bindings-the-problem) and how they compose
- [SwiftUI's new `redacted` API](/episodes/ep115-redacted-swiftui-the-problem)
- [Combine's Scheduler API](/episodes/ep104-combine-schedulers-testing-time) and how to test Combine code
- And what do you get when you design a Swift key path for enums? [Case paths!](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep87-the-case-for-case-paths-introduction)
