> Today we are open sourcing CasePaths, a library that introduces the power and ergonomics of key paths to enums!

---

We are excited to announce the 0.1.0 release of [CasePaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths), a new API that brings key path-like functionality and ergonomics to enums and unlocks the potential to write code that is generic over enums.

## Motivation

Swift endows every struct and class property with a [key path](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swift_standard_library/key-path_expressions).
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
struct User {
  var id: Int
  var name: String
}

\User.id   // WritableKeyPath<User, Int>
\User.name // WritableKeyPath<User, String>
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
This is compiler-generated code that can be used to abstractly zoom in on part of a structure, inspect and even change it, while propagating these changes to the structure's whole. They unlock the ability to do many things, like [key-value observing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/cocoa_design_patterns/using_key-value_observing_in_swift) and [reactive bindings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/receiving_and_handling_events_with_combine), [dynamic member lookup](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0252-keypath-dynamic-member-lookup.md), and scoping changes to the SwiftUI [environment](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environment).

Unfortunately, no such structure exists for enum cases!
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
enum Authentication {
  case authenticated(accessToken: String)
  case unauthenticated
}

\Authentication.authenticated // ðŸ›‘
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
And so it's impossible to write similar generic algorithms that can zoom in on a particular enum case.

## Introducing: case paths

[CasePaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths) intends to bridge this gap by introducing what we call "case paths." Case paths can be constructed simply by prepending the enum type and case name with a _forward_ slash:
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
import CasePaths

/Authentication.authenticated // CasePath<Authentication, String>
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
### Case paths vs. key paths

While key paths package up the functionality of getting and setting a value on a root structure, case paths package up the functionality of extracting and embedding a value on a root enumeration.
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
user[keyPath: \User.id] = 42
user[keyPath: \User.id] // 42

let authentication = (/Authentication.authenticated).embed("cafebeef")
(/Authentication.authenticated).extract(from: authentication) // Optional("cafebeef")
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
Case path extraction can fail and return `nil` because the cases may not match up.
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
(/Authentication.authenticated).extract(from: .unauthenticated) // nil
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
Case paths, like key paths, compose. Where key paths use dot-syntax to dive deeper into a structure, case paths use a double-dot syntax:
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
\HighScore.user.name
// WritableKeyPath<HighScore, String>

/Result<Authentication, Error>..Authentication.authenticated
// CasePath<Result<Authentication, Error>, String>
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
Case paths, also like key paths, provide an "[identity](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0227-identity-keypath.md)" path, which is useful for interacting with APIs that use key paths and case paths but you want to work with entire structure.
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
\User.self           // WritableKeyPath<User, User>
/Authentication.self // CasePath<Authentication, Authentication>
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
Key paths are created for every property, even computed ones, so what is the equivalent for case paths? "Computed" case paths can be created by providing custom `embed` and `extract` functions:
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
CasePath<Authentication, String>(
  embed: { decryptedToken in
    Authentication.authenticated(token: encrypt(decryptedToken))
  },
  extract: { authentication in
    guard
      case let .authenticated(encryptedToken) = authentication,
      let decryptedToken = decrypt(token)
      else { return nil }
    return decryptedToken
  }
)
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
Since Swift 5.2, key path expressions can be passed directly to methods like `map`. The same is true of case path expressions, which can be passed to methods like `compactMap`:
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
users.map(\User.name)
authentications.compactMap(/Authentication.authenticated)
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
## Ergonomic associated value access

CasePaths uses Swift reflection to automatically and extract associated values from _any_ enum in a single, short expression. This helpful utility is made available as a public module function that can be used in your own libraries and apps:
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
extract(case: Authentication.authenticated, from: .authenticated("cafebeef"))
// Optional("cafebeef")
"""#,
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: #"""
