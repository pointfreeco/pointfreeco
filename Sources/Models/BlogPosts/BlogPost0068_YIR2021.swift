# Highlights

2021 was our biggest year yet:

* **42** episodes released for a total of **29** hours of video.
* **72k** unique users visited the site.
* **121k** video views for a total of **4 years and 59 days** watching time.
* Open sourced **5** new [projects](#open-source).

But these high-level stats donâ€™t scratch the surface of what we covered in 2021:

## SwiftUI Navigation

By far, the most ambitious series of episodes we tackled in 2021 was SwiftUI navigation. Over the course of [9 episodes](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/swiftui/navigation)

TODO: UIKit, modularity

# ðŸŽ‰ 2022 ðŸŽ‰

We're thankful to all of our subscribers for supporting us and helping us create this content. We could not do it without you.

Next year we have even more planned, including a deep dive into Swift's new concurrency tools, improvements to the Composable Architecture to play better with concurrency and SwiftUI navigation, as well as all new parsing episodes (result builders, reversible parsing, routing) and more!

To celebrate the end of the year we are also offering [25% off](/discounts/2021-eoy) the first year for first-time subscribers. If youâ€™ve been on the fence on whether or not to subscribe, now is the time!

See you in 2022!
