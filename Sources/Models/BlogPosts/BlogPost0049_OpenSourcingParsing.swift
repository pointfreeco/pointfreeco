        We are excited to announce the 0.1.0 release of [Parsing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing), a library for turning nebulous data into well-structured data. It was built from the content of [21 episodes](/collections/parsing) (10 hours) where we show how to build a parsing library from scratch, with a focus on composition, performance, and generality:

        * **Composition**: The ability to break large, complex parsing problems down into smaller, simpler ones. And the ability to take small, simple parsers and easily combine them into larger, more complex ones.

        * **Performance**: Parsers that have been composed of many smaller parts should perform as well as highly-tuned, hand-written parsers.

        * **Generality**: The ability to parse _any_ kind of input into _any_ kind of output. This allows you to choose which abstraction levels you want to work with based on how much performance you need or how much correctness you want guaranteed. For example, you can write a highly tuned parser on collections of UTF-8 code units, and it will automatically plug into parsers of strings, arrays, unsafe buffer pointers and more.

        ## Motivation

        Parsing is a surprisingly ubiquitous problem in programming. We can define parsing as trying to take a more nebulous blob of data and transform it into something more well-structured. The Swift standard library comes with a number of parsers that we reach for every day. For example, there are initializers on `Int`, `Double`, and even `Bool`, that attempt to parse numbers and booleans from strings:

        ```swift
        Int("42")         // 42
        Int("Hello")      // nil

        Double("123.45")  // 123.45
        Double("Goodbye") // nil

        Bool("true")      // true
        Bool("0")         // nil
        ```

        And there are types like `JSONDecoder` and `PropertyListDecoder` that attempt to parse `Decodable`-conforming types from data:

        ```swift
        try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
        try PropertyListDecoder().decode(Settings.self, from: data)
        ```

        While parsers are everywhere in Swift, Swift has no holistic story _for_ parsing. Instead, we typically parse data in an ad hoc fashion using a number of unrelated initializers, methods, and other means. And this typically leads to less maintainable, less reusable code.

        This library aims to write such a story for parsing in Swift. It introduces a single unit of parsing that can be combined in interesting ways to form large, complex parsers that can tackle the programming problems you need to solve in a maintainable way.

        ## Getting started

        Suppose you have a string that holds some user data that you want to parse into an array of `User`s:

        ```swift
        var input = """
        1,Blob,true
        2,Blob Jr.,false
        3,Blob Sr.,true
        """

        struct User {
          var id: Int
          var name: String
          var isAdmin: Bool
        }
        ```

        A naive approach to this would be a nested use of `.split(separator:)`, and then a little bit of extra work to convert strings into integers and booleans:

        ```swift
        let users = input
          .split(separator: "\n")
          .compactMap { row -> User? in
            let fields = row.split(separator: ",")
            guard
              fields.count == 3,
              let id = Int(fields[0]),
              let isAdmin = Bool(String(fields[2]))
            else { return nil }

            return User(id: id, name: String(fields[1]), isAdmin: isAdmin)
          }
        ```
                                                                  
        Not only is this code a little messy, but it is also inefficient since we are allocating arrays for the `.split` and then just immediately throwing away those values.

        It would be more straightforward and efficient to instead describe how to consume bits from the beginning of the input and convert that into users. This is what this parser library excels at ðŸ˜„.

        We can start by describing what it means to parse a single row, first by parsing an integer off the front of the string, and then parsing a comma that we discard using the `.skip` operator:

        ```swift
        let user = Int.parser()
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
        ```

        Already this can consume the beginning of the input:

        ```swift
        user.parse(&input) // => 1
        input // => "Blob,true\n2,Blob Jr.,false\n3,Blob Sr.,true"
        ```

        Next we want to take everything up until the next comma for the user's name, and then skip the comma:

        ```swift
        let user = Int.parser()
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
          .take(PrefixWhile { $0 != "," })
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
        ```

        Here the `.take` operator has combined parsed values together into a tuple, `(Int, Substring)`.

        And then we want to take the boolean at the end of the row for the user's admin status:

        ```swift
        let user = Int.parser()
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
          .take(PrefixWhile { $0 != "," })
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
          .take(Bool.parser())
        ```

        Currently this will parse a tuple `(Int, Substring, Bool)` from the input, and we can `.map` on that to turn it into a `User`:

        ```swift
        let user = Int.parser()
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
          .take(PrefixWhile { $0 != "," })
          .skip(StartsWith(","))
          .take(Bool.parser())
          .map { User(id: $0, name: String($1), isAdmin: $2) }
        ```

        That is enough to parse a single user from the input string:

        ```swift
        user.parse(&input) // => User(id: 1, name: "Blob", isAdmin: true)
        input // => "\n2,Blob Jr.,false\n3,Blob Sr.,true"
        ```

        To parse multiple users from the input we can use the `Many` parser:

        ```swift
        let users = Many(user, separator: StartsWith("\n"))

        user.parse(&input) // => [User(id: 1, name: "Blob", isAdmin: true), â€¦]
        input // => ""
        ```

        Now this parser can process an entire document of users, and the code is simpler and more straightforward than the version that uses `.split` and `.compactMap`.

        Even better, it's more performant. We've written [benchmarks](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing/blob/main/Sources/swift-parsing-benchmark/ReadmeExample.swift) for these two styles of parsing, and the `.split`-style of parsing is more than twice as slow:

        ```
        name                             time        std        iterations
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        README Example.Parser: Substring 3426.000 ns Â±  63.40 %     385395
        README Example.Adhoc             7631.000 ns Â±  47.01 %     169332
        Program ended with exit code: 0
        ```

        Further, if you are willing write your parsers against `UTF8View` instead of `Substring`, you can eke out even more performance, more than doubling the speed:

        ```
        name                             time        std        iterations
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        README Example.Parser: Substring 3693.000 ns Â±  81.76 %     349763
        README Example.Parser: UTF8      1272.000 ns Â± 128.16 %     999150
        README Example.Adhoc             8504.000 ns Â±  59.59 %     151417
        ```

        We can also compare these times to a tool that Apple's Foundation gives us: `Scanner`. It's a type that allows you to consume from the beginning of strings in order to produce values, and provides a nicer API than using `.split`:

        ```swift
        var users: [User] = []
        while scanner.currentIndex != input.endIndex {
          guard
            let id = scanner.scanInt(),
            let _ = scanner.scanString(","),
            let name = scanner.scanUpToString(","),
            let _ = scanner.scanString(","),
            let isAdmin = scanner.scanBool()
          else { break }

          users.append(User(id: id, name: name, isAdmin: isAdmin))
          _ = scanner.scanString("\n")
        }
        ```

        However, the `Scanner` style of parsing is more than 5 times as slow as the substring parser written above, and more than 15 times slower than the UTF-8 parser:

        ```
        name                             time         std        iterations
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        README Example.Parser: Substring  3481.000 ns Â±  65.04 %     376525
        README Example.Parser: UTF8       1207.000 ns Â± 110.96 %    1000000
        README Example.Adhoc              8029.000 ns Â±  44.44 %     163719
        README Example.Scanner           19786.000 ns Â±  35.26 %      62125
        ```

        That's the basics of parsing a simple string format, but there's a lot more operators and tricks to learn in order to performantly parse larger inputs. View the [benchmarks](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing/blob/main/Sources/swift-parsing-benchmark) for examples of real life parsing scenarios.

        ## Design

        ### Protocol

        The design of the library is largely inspired by the Swift standard library and Appleâ€™s Combine framework. A parser is represented as a protocol that many types conform to, and then parser transformations (also known as "combinators") are methods that return concrete types conforming to the parser protocol.

        For example, to parse all the characters from the beginning of a substring until you encounter a comma you can use the `Prefix` parser:

        ```swift
        let parser = Prefix<Substring> { $0 != "," }

        var input = "Hello,World"[...]
        parser.parse(&input) // => "Hello"
        input // => ",Hello"
        ```

        The type of this parser is:

        ```swift
        Prefix<Substring>
        ```

        We can `.map` on this parser in order to transform its output, which in this case is the string "Hello":

        ```swift
        let parser = Prefix<Substring> { $0 != "," }
          .map { $0 + "!!!" }

        var input = "Hello,World"[...]
        parser.parse(&input) // => "Hello!!!"
        input // => ",Hello"
        ```

        The type of this parser is now:

        ```swift
        Parsers.Map<Prefix<Substring>, Substring>
        ```

        Notice how the type of the parser encodes the operations that we performed. This adds a bit of complexity when using these types, but comes with some performance benefits because Swift can usually optimize the creation of those nested types.

        ### Low-level versus high-level

        The library makes it easy to choose which abstraction level you want to work on. Both low-level and high-level have their pros and cons.

        Parsing low-level inputs, such as UTF-8 code units, has better performance, but at the cost of potentially losing correctness. A canonical example of this is trying to parse the character "Ã©", which can be represented in code units as `[233]` or `[101, 769]`. If you don't remember to always parse both representations you may have a bug where you accidentally fail your parser when it encounters a code unit sequence you don't support.

        On the other hand, parsing high-level inputs, such as `String`, can guarantee correctness, but at the cost of performance. For example, `String` handles the complexities of extended grapheme clusters and UTF-8 normalization for you, but traversing strings is slower since its elements are variable width.

        The library gives you the tools that allow you to choose which abstraction level you want to work on, as well as the ability to fluidly move between abstraction levels where it makes sense.

        For example, say we want to parse particular city names from the beginning of a string:

        ```swift
        enum City {
          case london
          case newYork
          case sanJose
        }
        ```

        Because "San JosÃ©" has an accented character, the safest way to parse it is to parse on the `Substring` abstraction level:

        ```swift
        let city = StartsWith<Substring>("London").map { City.london }
          .orElse(StartsWith("New York").map { .newYork })
          .orElse(StartsWith("San JosÃ©").map { .sanJose })

        var input = "San JosÃ©,123"
        city.parse(&input) // => City.sanJose
        input // => ",123"
        ```

        However, we are incurring the cost of parsing `Substring` for this entire parser, even though only the "San JosÃ©" case needs that power. We can refactor this parser so that "London" and "New York" are parsed on the `UTF8View` level, since they consist of only ASCII characters, and then parse "San JosÃ©" as `Substring`:

        ```swift
        let city = StartsWith("London".utf8).map { City.london }
          .orElse(StartsWith("New York".utf8).map { .newYork })
          .orElse(StartsWith("San JosÃ©").utf8.map { .sanJose })
        ```

        It's subtle, but `StartsWith("London".utf8)` is a parser that parses the code units for "London" from the beginning of a `UTF8View`, whereas `StartsWith("San JosÃ©").utf8` parses "San JosÃ©" as a `Substring`, and then converts that into a `UTF8View` parser.

        This allows you to parse as much as possible on the more performant, low-level `UTF8View`, while still allowing you to parse on the more correct, high-level `Substring` when necessary.

        ## Benchmarks
