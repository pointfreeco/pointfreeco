Today we are excited to announce that you can now [gift a Point-Free subscription](/gifts) to your friends, colleagues, and loved ones. Itâ€™s the perfect gift for those wanting to dive deeper into real world topics of Swift development, including [SwiftUI](/collections/swift-ui), [The Composable Architecture](/collections/composable-architecture), [dependencies](/collections/dependencies), [parsing](/collections/parsing), and much, much, [much](/collections) more!

### How do gifts work?

**Will I be charged on a recurring basis?**
Nope. A gift subscription is a one-time payment and you will not be charged again.

**When am I charged and when does the gift subscription start?**
You are charged immediately, but the subscription does not start until the recipient accepts your gift.

**Can I accept a gift if I already have a Point-Free subscription?**
Yes! If you receive a gift and are currently a subscriber we will apply the credit to your account and the amount will be applied to future invoices.

**Can gifts be purchased with student discounts, referrals, regional discounts, etc.?**
Unfortunately not at this time. Gift subscriptions are charged at the full price of our [regular](/pricing) subscriptions.

**Do I need to give a credit card to redeem the gift?**
Nope. No credit card is required, and when the gift time is almost up we will send you an email to see if you want to continue your subscription.

**I have another question not covered here.**
No problem, [email us](support@pointfree.co) any questions and we will get back to you right away.
