We want as many people as possible to have access to Point-Free's videos, which is why nearly 2 years ago we offered 50% off to [students](/blog/posts/10-announcing-student-discounts), and it's why today we are excited to announce we now offer [regional discounts](/subscribe/personal?useRegionalDiscount=true).

The [regional discount](/subscribe/personal?useRegionalDiscount=true) takes 50% off a monthly or yearly personal subscription to anyone whose credit card is issued from a particular list of countries. This is to help make up for currency discrepencies between the United States and other countries, and hopefully relieves some of the burden of paying for the subscription in U.S. dollars.

If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@pointfree.co)!
