**isowords** is a word search game on a vanishing cube. Connect letters on the cube to form words, the longer the better, and the third time a letter is used its cube is removed, revealing letters inside!

- Spell words by connecting letters on a 3-dimensional cube
- The longer the word, the more points you earn!
- Use each face wisely! Once you use a letter 3 times its cube will disappear, revealing more letters underneath.
- THREE GAME MODES: timed, unlimited, and multiplayer!
- DAILY CHALLENGE: everyone in the world plays the same puzzles.
- Global leaderboards show how you stack up against everyone in the world.

### Multiplayer mode

- Go head-to-head with another player by taking turns on the same cube
