        **isowords** is a word search game on a vanishing cube. Connect letters on the cube to form words, the longer the better, and the third time a letter is used its cube is removed, revealing letters inside!

        - Spell words by connecting letters on a 3-dimensional cube
        - The longer the word, the more points you earn!
        - Use each face wisely! Once you use a letter 3 times its cube will disappear, revealing more letters underneath.
        - THREE GAME MODES: timed, unlimited, and multiplayer!
        - DAILY CHALLENGE: everyone in the world plays the same puzzles.
        - Global leaderboards show how you stack up against everyone in the world.

        ### Multiplayer mode

        - Go head-to-head with another player by taking turns on the same cube
        - COMPETE against friends or let isowords find you an opponent

        ### Relax while finding words
