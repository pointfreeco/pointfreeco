## Exercise 1

tuple of the form `(A, (B, C))` to `(A, B, C)`. Create a few overloaded functions named `unpack` to automate
this.

This function can be handy for juggling nested tuples, and it's straightforward to define the first few
overloads:

## Exercise 3

> Do you think `zip2` can be seen as a kind of associative infix operator? For example, is it true that
`zip(xs, zip(ys, zs)) == zip(zip(xs, ys), zs)`? If it's not strictly true, can you define an equivalence
between them?

Unfortunately `zip` cannot be made into an associative infix operator because the resulting type from
`zip(xs, zip(ys, zs))` is `(A, (B, C))`, whereas from `zip(zip(xs, ys), zs)` it is `((A, B), C)`. You
can of course define a `repack` helper that transforms between those nested tuple types, but it's just not
_strictly_ true that `zip` is associative.

We ended up solving this in [part 2](/episodes/ep24-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-2) of our zip series.
To implement `zip` on results you must `switch` over two result values, and then handle the four cases.
Three of those cases are straightforward to implement, and in fact there is only one possible implementation.
The last case, however, has two possible implementations, and both throw away some information, which seems
not ideal:

why this is not ideal, and to see how a whole new type that is closely related to `Result` solves this
problem very neatly.

## Exercise 7

function on the `A` type parameter. Also define `zip3`, `zip2(with:)` and `zip3(with:)`.

We also ended up solving this in [part 2](/episodes/ep24-the-many-faces-of-zip-part-2) of our zip series.

structures? Write the signature of such a function and implement it.

the signature of such a function and implement it.

is showing is that nested zippable containers are also zippable containers because `zip` on the nesting can

nested containers when one of those containers is a tuple, e.g. we can transform a tuple of arrays to an
array of tuples `([A], [B]) -> [(A, B)]`. There's a more general concept that aims to flip containers of any
type. Implement the following to the best of your ability, and describe in words what they represent:

are both the same container type. What does this represent? Evaluate the function on a few sample nested
arrays.

### Exercise 14.7

transforms into an optional array, an array of results transforms into a result of an array, or a
validated optional transforms into an optional validation, etc.

The implementation for `alt` on `Validated` is very similar.

Finally, we have the `Parallel` type. How can we combine two `Parallel<A>`'s into just a single one? If
we were to run both parallel values at the same time, and then at a later time procure two values of type
`A` from them, there still wouldn't be anyway to combine both values into one since we know _nothing_ about
the type `A`. Seems like no matter what we have to discard information. Similar to what we've done with
`Result`, maybe we should only take the first one that finishes? We can implement that like so:

Semantically this means that we are _racing_ both parallels, and just picking the one that is fastest.
