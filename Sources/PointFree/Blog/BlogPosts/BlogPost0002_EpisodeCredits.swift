      In our episode on [algebraic data types](\(url(to: .episode(.left("ep4-algebraic-data-types"))))) we
      showed how there is algebra lurking in the Swift type system, and then used that knowledge to refactor
      our data types so that the invalid states are unrepresentable by the compiler. You simply were not
      allowed to construct invalid values, and it was proven to us by the compiler!

      In today's [Point-Free Pointer](\(url(to: .blog(.index)))) we are going to apply this to a real world
      problem. In fact, we are going to analyze a [data type](https://github.com/pointfreeco/pointfreeco/blob/c3a03fda2817418cc74d66da6c21e3fede0574f7/Sources/PointFree/Episode/Show.swift#L841-L854)
      that I made for a feature on this very site. I
      did it completely wrong the first time, and it held lots of values that were just completely
      nonsensical. I convinced myself that it wasn't going to be a problem, and just rolled with it for
      awhile. But, I kept finding myself adding lil `if let`s here and lil `guard let`s there, until finally
      I said enough is enough, it's time to refactor. The amazing part is that I literally used algebra to do
      this refactoring, and so today I want to walk you through exactly how I dissected this problem.

      But first, let me describe the feature I was working on.

      While most of our episodes are for subscribers only, we wanted to give people the opportunity to see a
      video of their choosing for free. All they had to do was sign up for our newsletter, and they would get
      a credit that could be used on any subscriber-only episode.

      Now, when a user is on the episode page, we have this lil module to callout that users can subscriber
      to our series or sign up to get a credit. The messaging in that box depends on quite a few states.

      It can change depending on whether or not you are logged in, or if you are a subscriber already or not,
      or if you've already used your credit for this episode, and finally if this episode is free to the
      public or subscriber only. Naively this would be `2^4 = 16` states, many of which don't make any sense.
      Like, you can't be logged out and a subscriber. We want to omit those states, so let's use algebra!

system can greatly simplify the types we work with. Also, the code for this entire website, including
