We often work with collections that we know should _never_ be empty, but the types we are given in the Swift
standard library make no such guarantees. To compensate, we must sprinkle `if`'s and `guard`'s into our code
so that we can protect against the case that we know should be impossible.

We've explored the concept of "algebraic data types" a few times on this series, and it's a topic almost
entirely devoted to the endeavor of making "impossible states unrepresentable" by the compiler. Our most
recent [episode](\(url(to: .episode(.left("20-nonempty"))))) even showed how we could use algebra to
naturally lead us to a type that gives us compile-time guarantees that a collection can never be empty.

We believe that a compiler proven non-empty type is incredibly important for every developer to have at
their disposal, and so that's why today we are open sourcing our
[NonEmpty](\(gitHubUrl(to: .repo(.nonempty)))) library.

The core of the library is just a single generic type, `NonEmpty<C>`, which allows you to transform any
collection type `C` into a non-empty version of itself. The majority of the code in the library consists
of conformances on `NonEmpty` to make it act as much like the collection that it wraps.

Using `NonEmpty` it is very easy to model an array that is provable to _never_ be empty:

There are many applications of non-empty collection types, but it can be hard to see since the Swift standard
library does not give us this type. We don't often think about whether or not a non-empty array would be
more appropriate than a potentially empty array.

Here are just a few such applications:

### `groupBy`

We often reach for arrays in our API design because that is what we have at hand, but many times it can
be strenghtened to a non-empty array. For example, consider implementing a `groupBy` function on `Sequence`:
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
extension Sequence {
  func groupBy<A>(_ f: (Element) -> A) -> [A: [Element]] {
    var result: [A: [Element]] = [:]
    for element in self {
      let key = f(element)
      if result[key] == nil {
        result[key] = [element]
      } else {
        result[key]?.append(element)
      }
    }
    return result
  }
}

Array(1...10)
  .groupBy { $0 % 3 }
// [0: [3, 6, 9], 1: [1, 4, 7, 10], 2: [2, 5, 8]]
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
The implementation is pretty straightforward, and it works well enough. However, can the `[Element]` array
inside the return ever be empty? What key value in `A` could even be associated with an empty array? The
only way to generate `A` values is from `Element` values.

Indeed, the `[Element]` array can _never_ be empty, but the API isn't letting us know that. So in our code,
when we interact with this array we are invariably going to have to deal with its potential emptiness.

Let's strengthen this API by using `NonEmpty`!

    .init(
      content: """
We didn't have to change much in the implementation, we get essentially the same output, but the API is
describing more about the data it returns now.

### Random Values

Swift 4.2 introduces a new random API, and apart of the API is the ability to get a random value from a
collection:

""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: """

    .init(
      content: """
Notice that the API returns an optional, and that is necessary because the array could have been empty.
But, we see right here it is definitely _not_ empty. We have provided the values right inline with an
array literal. And computing random values like this, with an inline array literal, is quite common,
so it'd be nice if we could avoid the optional since it's obvious the array is non-empty. And we can!

      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph

NonEmptyArray(1, 2, 3, 4).randomElement() // 2

      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
The random API will return non-optional values when operating on the `NonEmpty` type.

### GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs that's getting more and more popular. We might
write a client that generates a query from a list of fields for a GraphQL type, and we may default to using a
plain ole array or set since thatâ€™s whatâ€™s available to us in the standard library. Here's an example of
a very simple fieldset and query builder:
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
enum UserField: String {
  case id, name, email
}

func query(_ fields: Set<UserField>) -> String {
  return (["{"] + fields.map { "\\($0.rawValue)" } + ["}"])
    .joined(separator: " ")
}

print(query([.name, .email]))
// { name email }

print(query([]))
// { }
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
This last line is a programmer error and makes an invalid GraphQL query. GraphQL requires at least one
field be provided. So, the server will reject it with an error and now the client has to handle this case.

It would have been better to use a `NonEmptySet` instead of a plain `Set`. Amazingly the implementation of
`query` doesn't need to change, just the call site:
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
func query(_ fields: NonEmptySet<UserField>) -> String {
  return (["{"] + fields.map { "\\($0.rawValue)" } + ["}"])
    .joined(separator: " ")
}

print(query(.init(.name, .email)))
// { name email }

print(query(.init()))
// ðŸ›‘ Compile error
""",
      timestamp: nil,
      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: """
We now have the compiler proving to us that it is impossible to generate an invalid GraphQL query of this
form.

### `Validated`

Let's do one more just to show how often these non-empty types pop up in every day coding!

The `Result` type is quite popular in the Swift community, and it's useful for distinguishing a successful
value from a failure.

      timestamp: nil,

  case failure(Error)

      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),

    .init(
      content: """

We have now see 4 applications of the `NonEmpty` type, but there are so many more. We encourage the reader
to start looking critically at their own application code, their library APIs and their interactions with
other APIs to see where non-empty types might be appropriate. By pushing the non-emptiness requirement to
the type level you get to enforce this invariant in a single place rather than sprinkle `if`'s and `guard`'s
into your code.
