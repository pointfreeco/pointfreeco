The [Tagged](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-tagged) type is a powerful way of creating new types in a
very lightweight way. It's a small package that leverages many advanced features of Swift, including generics,
generic type aliases, phantom types and conditional conformance. We've
[previously](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep12-tagged) explored ways of using `Tagged` to strengthen
our types by better documenting their intentions and making accidental misuse of the types provably
impossible by the compiler.

In this [Point-Free Pointer](\(url(to: .blog(.index)))) we will show another application: building a
type-safe abstraction for dealing with seconds and milliseconds.

We've already made this type a little bit safer by defining a type alias `Blog.Id`, which makes a blog
post's `id` field completely different from any other `Int` in the eyes of the compiler. The `Tagged` type
made this very easy to do, and with the help of Swift's conditional conformances we were able to make
`BlogPost` decodable without any additional work.

However, the `publishedAt` field seems a little unsafe. I happen to know for a fact that this time comes back
from the API measured in seconds, but others on my team or future contributors may not know this. And it's
pretty common for APIs to send back milliseconds, so someone could easily get this confused at some point.
Worse, this `publishedAt` value might be extracted from a blog post and then passed through a few layers of
functions, so by the time I come across this value I may not even know where it came from!

One approach to fixing this would be to rename the field to something more descriptive, like
`publishedAtInSeconds`, but now you have accidentally broken JSON decoding since the field name won't
match. This means you have to implement a custom decode initializer, which can be a pain, but more
importantly you could still misuse this type by comparing it to something measured in milliseconds.
The compiler isn't able to help you at all.

Let's fix that!

The compiler caught a serious bug here! Since milliseconds are much larger numbers than seconds, this

to remember which fields are measured in seconds and which fields are in milliseconds. The compiler has
all that information and will keep us in check!
