Swift 4 introduced the [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) set of protocols and made working with JSON a breeze, eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate we previously had to write! Swift 4.1's [conditional conformance](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/) unlocks even _more_ potential, and lets us delete even _more_ boilerplate. Let's take a look at one particular example.

Many APIs let clients fetch more data in fewer requests by providing a way to include related resources. For example, the Stripe API supports ["expanding objects"](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects): wherever the API may by default return a customer ID, the client may instead request a fully expanded customer data type.

In Swift, we can represent the idea of such an expandable object using the following type:

This short protocol extension fully generalizes the idea of decoding different kinds of values!

But what's this kind of decoding good for other than expandable properties? Well, any time we expect to decode _either_ one type _or_ another, we can use `Either`. For instance, we can decode API errors alongside the API data types we hope to fetch. Given a struct that represents an API error:
