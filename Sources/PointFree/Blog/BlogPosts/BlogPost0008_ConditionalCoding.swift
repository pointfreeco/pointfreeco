Swift 4 introduced the [`Codable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) set of protocols and made working with JSON a breeze, eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate! Swift 4.1's [conditional conformance](https://swift.org/blog/conditional-conformance/) unlocks even more potential, and lets us delete even more boilerplate. Let's take a look at one particular example.

Many APIs let clients fetch more data in fewer requests by specifying a means of including related resources.

Now we've fully generalized the idea of decoding different kinds of values!

What's this kind of decoding good for other than expandable properties? Well, any time we expect to decode _either_ one type _or_ another, we can use `Either`. This means we can decode API errors alongside the data types we expect. Given a struct that represents an API error:

It's pretty amazing that we were able to reuse our generalized solution for `Expandable` for a totally different use case. We didn't have to write any more custom decoding logic: `Either` works like an `if`â€”`else` statement for decoding.

That's two examples. How about a third one for good luck?
