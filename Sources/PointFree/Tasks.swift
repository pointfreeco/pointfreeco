      If you're having trouble deciding on an episode, here are a few of our favorites:

      * [The Many Faces of Map](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep13-the-many-faces-of-map)

        We take a tour of the `map` function and figure out just what makes it so special!

      * [Contravariance](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep14-contravariance)

        A fun, mind-bendy episode that explores what it means to the take that `map` function and flip it
        around!

      * [Tagged](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep12-tagged)

        This one's a bit more down-to-earth! We talk about type-safety and how Swift's type system gives us
        yet another powerful tool to prevent bugs _at compile time!_

      * [Setters: Part 1](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep6-functional-setters)

        Setters are functions that make you rethink function composition in some pretty powerful ways! This is
        the first of a multi-part series that goes _deep!_

      We hope you'll find it interesting enough to consider
      [getting a subscription](\(url(to: .pricing(nil, expand: nil)))) for yourself or your team!
