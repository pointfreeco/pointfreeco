      It's been a week since you signed up for [Point-Free](\(siteRouter.url(for: .home))). We hope you've learned
      something new about functional programming, and maybe even introduced it into your codebase!

        episode, and click the "\(useCreditCTA)" button!

        Here are some of our most popular collections of episodes:

        * [Composable Architecture](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture)
        
          Learn how to build an architecture from the ground up, with a focus on ergnomics, composition,
        testing, and more.
        
        * [SwiftUI](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/swiftui)
        
          We dive deep into some of the subtler, more complex topics of SwiftUI, such as bindings, animation
        and navigation.
        
        * [Dependencies](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/dependencies)
        
          Dependencies can wreak havoc on a codebase. We take the time to properly define what a dependency is,
        why they are so complex, and how we can take control of them rather than letting them control us.
        
        * [Parsing](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/parsing)
        
          Parsing is the process of turning nebulous input data into well-structured output data. It's a
        surprisingly ubiquitous topic, and our episodes are the perfect place to get started.
