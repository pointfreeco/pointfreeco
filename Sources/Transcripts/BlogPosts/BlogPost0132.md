[[Join livestream]](/live)

Join us to discuss the [latest release][1.7-release] of the 
[Composable Architecture][tca-gh], which brought brand new observation tools to the library.
We will also unveil a surprise release of the library bringing all new super powers to the 
`@Reducer` macro, _and_ we will announce a new beta for the library that solves one of the most
frequent problems people ask about when using the library.

It's going to be action packed, so be sure to tune in and bring your questions:
