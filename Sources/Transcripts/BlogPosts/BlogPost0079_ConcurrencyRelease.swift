    Today we are releasing the biggest update to the Composable Architecture since it's first
    release over 2 years ago. The library has all new concurrency tools allowing you to construct
    complex effects using structured concurrency, tie effect lifetimes to view lifetimes, and
    we accomplish all of this while keeping your code 100% testable. We think it might even be the
    best way to test concurrent code in SwiftUI applications. ðŸ˜‡
