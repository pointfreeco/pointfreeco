        This is the perfect time to get full access to our videos:

        * We _just_ kicked off our deep-dive into [concurrency](/collections/concurrency), starting with threads and queues, and building up to Swift's modern tools.
        * Building an [application architecture](/collections/composable-architecture) from scratch that is perfectly suited for SwiftUI and UIKit applications.
        * [Case studies](/collections/case-studies) that dive deep into solving common, real-world problems.
        * A deep-dive into [parsing](/collections/parsing) exploring techniques for parsing complex string formats, with a focus on composition and performance.
        * An extensive and practical study of [dependencies](/collections/dependencies), showing how to take control of dependencies to unleash some amazing benefits.
        * And [more...](/)

        We hope youâ€™ll [join us](/discounts/wwdc-2022) for all of the great material we have planned for the rest of the year!
