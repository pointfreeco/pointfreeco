This is the perfect time to get full access to all of our videos. In the past year we have explored 
many advanced topics of Swift and SwiftUI, including:

* ### Modern UIKit

  This is our [newest series of episodes][modern-uikit-collection], and it is still currently in 
  progress. We will show that the Observation framework in Swift allows us to completely 
  revolutionize how one writes UIKit apps. We can provide powerful state management tools and 
  navigation tools that allow us to write UIKit features in a style that looks very similar to 
  SwiftUI.  

* ### A tour of the Composable Architecture 1.0

  A little less than 1 year ago we [released 1.0][tca-1.0-blog] of the Composable Architecture,
  and along with it we released a brand new [tour series of episodes][tour-tca-1.0]. The tour builds
  a moderately complex app from scratch, and along the way you will learn value lessons in domain
  modeling, dependencies and controlling side effects, navigation, testing and more.

* ### Observation

  We dove _deep_ into the [observation tools][observation-collection] of Swift, and showed how they 
  could be applied to the [Composable Architecture][observation-tca-collection]. We even 
  [back ported][perception-blog] Swift's observation tools so that they can run on platforms going
  all the way back to iOS 13!
  
* ### Shared state

  Sharing state in the Composable Architecture has been, historically, quite difficult because of
  the library's preference for one to model their domains with value types instead of reference
  types. We [finally solved the problem][sharing-state-collection] in a way that allows one to
  still embrace value types _and_ still exhaustively test features that are sharing state. And
  we even incorporated persistence into the solution too!
  
* ### Macros

  Macros are a powerful Swift feature, and they are only going to get more powerful. But what
  does it take to build complex macros, and further how do you test and debug them? We have 
  just the [collection of episodes][macros-collection] for you.

And honestly, the above is only scratching the surface of what we have covered in the last 6 years 
since Point-Free launched. We have a vast [backlog][collections] of episodes that may interest,
with topics ranging from [algebraic data types][adt-collection], a deep dive into the fundamental
concepts of [map, zip and flatMap][map-zip-flatmap], the most advanced content on 
[concurrency][concurrency-collection] out there, access to all of our past 
[livestreams][livestreams], and more!
