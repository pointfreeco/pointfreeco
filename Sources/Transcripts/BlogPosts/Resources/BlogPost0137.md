The Composable Architecture recently [turned 4 years old][tca-4-bday], and we're celebrating by
hosting a live stream to discuss all things app architecture!

Have a question about the Composable Architecture? Want to know how it compares to other styles
of building apps? Or just want to discuss the philosophy of app architecture in general?
Well, we have the live stream for you!

It's going to be action packed, so be sure to tune in and bring your questions!
