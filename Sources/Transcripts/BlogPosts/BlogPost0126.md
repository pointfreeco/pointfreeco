## Episodes

This year's episodes were action-packed, to say the least. We made use of many new, advanced
features of Swift 5.8 and 5.9, including concurrency tools, executors, observation, macros (and 
more‚Ä¶) in order to push the Swift language and SwiftUI to the limit of what they can accomplish: 

<div id="modern-swiftui"></div>

### Modern SwiftUI

We began the year with a [7-part series][modern-swiftui-collection] discussing modern SwiftUI 
techniques. This includes proper domain modeling for navigation, properly handling side effects,
controlling dependencies, and writing extensive tests for features, including how multiple features
integrate together. 

We demonstrated these principles by rebuilding one of Apple's more interesting demo apps, the
[Scrumdinger][scrumdinger]. We recreated the entire app from scratch, but using modern techniques
each step of the way. If you put in a little bit of upfront work while building your applications 
you get a ton of benefits down the road, such as easy deep-linking, simple communication patterns
between features, a [unified API for navigation][gut-syncups]:

[gut-syncups]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/syncups/blob/a9a60da0b7f163acaeef863b5e5aa70831466400/SyncUps-TreeBased/SyncUps/SyncUpDetail.swift#L238-L247

```swift
.navigationDestination(item: self.$model.destination.meeting) { meeting in
  MeetingView(meeting: meeting, syncUp: self.model.syncUp)
}
.navigationDestination(item: self.$model.destination.record) { recordModel in
  RecordMeetingView(model: recordModel)
}
.sheet(item: self.$model.destination.edit) { editModel in
  SyncUpFormView(model: editModel)
}
.alert(self.$model.destination.alert) { action in
  await self.model.alertButtonTapped(action)
}
```

‚Ä¶and a lot more.

And at the end of the series we even [open-sourced][syncups-gh] the app, built in two different 
styles: one using what we call ["tree-based" navigation][tree-based-syncups] (i.e. when navigation 
is driven by optional state) and the other using ["stack-based" navigation][stack-based-syncups] 
(i.e. when navigation is  driven by a collection).

We even made a [call-to-action][syncups-cta] to the community to rebuild the app in the style that
they enjoy the most. Architecture debates in the community tend to be a lot of abstract platitudes
and hand wringing, but there's no better way to show off your ideas that to build it concretely
and share with the world.

### First ever live stream

This year we also had our first ever [live stream][live-stream] where we discussed our newly
released [dependencies][dependencies-gh] library, and we live refactored how navigation was 
modeled in the SyncUps application we built for our [Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui-collection] 
series.

In that series we modeled the navigation of the app in what we like to call the ["tree-based" 
style][tree-based-syncups]. This is where each feature models the places it can navigate to with a 
single piece of optional enum state, where each case of the enum is a possible destination. The 
nesting of those enums form a tree-like structure.

This style is different from what we like to call ["stack-based" navigation][stack-based-syncups], 
where drill-down navigation is modeled as a single flat array of destinations. Each style has their 
[pros and cons][what-is-nav],  but we still wanted to show how it would look to build the app with 
stack-based navigation, so we did it [live][nav-live-stream]!

### Reliably testing async

In 2022 we posted a seemingly innocent question about [how to reliably test async code in 
Swift][reliably-testing-async-forums]. Well, 1.5 years later, 126 replies and 20k views later‚Ä¶ there
still is no official word from Apple on how to accomplish this.  

Even something as straightfoward as this:

```swift
func buttonTapped() async throws {
  self.isLoading = true 
  defer { self.isLoading = false }
  
  self.data = nil
  self.data = try await self.apiClient.fetch()
}
```

‚Ä¶is not easy to test. There just are no tools that allow us to deterministically assert on what 
happens in between units of async work. We have to sprinkle in some `Task.yield`s in our tests and 
hope that it‚Äôs enough, but we'll never know for sure.

So, this year we took matters into our own hands by releasing a 
[5-part series][testing-async-code-collection] exploring how one can embrace the amazing concurrency 
tools of Swift while not sacrificing testability. We start with two free(!) episodes 
([here][testing-async-the-problem-1] and [here][testing-async-the-problem-2]) exploring the problem 
space and seeing why it is essentially impossible to determinstically test any moderately complex 
Swift code that uses `await`. And by the end of the series we built a tool that allows one to test
async code in a style that is more familiar to testing synchronous and Combine/reactive code. And we 
[released a library][concurrency-extras-gh] to give everyone access to this tool.

Be sure to also check out our full [concurrency collection][concurrency-collection] of episodes that
discusses topics that haven't gotten much attention in the community, such as a full past-to-future
deep dive into concurrency, as well as clocks and time-based asynchrony.

### Tour of the Composable Architecture 1.0

It's hard to believe, but it was only this year that we finally released 1.0 of our popular library,
the [Composable Architecture][tca-gh]. To celebrate we released a brand new [tour of the 
library][tca-1.0-collection] where we rebuilt Apple's demo application, the 
[Scrumdinger][scrumdinger], using the Composable Architecture. (Incidentally we also rebuilt this
app without the Composable Architecture, and using only [modern, vanilla SwiftUI 
techniques](#modern-swiftui).)

Along the way we uncovered many benefits to using the Composable Architecture over vanilla SwiftUI,
such as:

* The ability to use value types for our domain rather than being forced to use reference types
and incur the complexity that comes with them.
* Easy integration of features together so that they can easily communicate with each other. 
* Immediate ability to deep-link into any state of our application.
* Instant testability, including how features integrate together and exhaustively proving how
state involves in the app and how effects feed data back into the system.

‚Ä¶and a whole bunch more.

### Testing & Debugging Macros

https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep251-testing-debugging-macros-part-2
https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep250-testing-debugging-macros-part-1

### Deep dive into Swift's observation tools

We released a [collection][observation-collection] of episodes that dive deep into Swift 5.9's 
observation tools, including the new `@Observable` macro and the `withObservationTracking` function. 
While it's clear that the tools are built primarily with SwiftUI in mind, they are still quite 
powerful.

We broke the series up into 5 major parts:

* We begin with a look at the tools of the past, including the `@State` and `@ObservedObject` 
property wrappers that were in SwiftUI since it's first release. They were handy, but they also 
came with some gotchas, and forced you to write your features in an unnatural style.
* Next we move onto the new observation tools in Swift 5.9, and show how they improve upon every
aspect of the `@State` and `@ObservedObject` property wrappers. We even dive into some of the code
in the open source Swift repository.
* Then we show that although the new tools are amazing, even ‚ú®magical‚ú®, they do come with some
gotchas. It is very important to be familiar with these subtleties in order to best wield these
tools.
* Next we show off a very theoretical _future_ direction of observation in Swift, and that is 
"observable structs." Now unfortunately Swift's observation tools do not work with structs, and
for good reason. But that doesn't mean we can't try!
* And finally we demonstrate "observation in practice" by taking the application we built during 
our [Modern SwiftUI][modern-swiftui-collection] series and refactoring it to use the new 
`@Observable` macro.

### Case paths revolution

Key paths are an amazing feature of Swift. They allow you to abstractly isolate a particular field
from the whole of a struct, and they unlock a lot of amazing capabillities that we all probably take
for granted these days. But to our knowledge, Swift is the _only_ modern programming language 
that has first class support for something like key paths. 

However, there is a crucial part of the story missing from Swift. If key paths are great for 
isolating a property from a struct, what about isolating a _case_ from an enum? Certainly there has
to be many uses for such a concept considering how powerful enums are for concisely modeling 
domains.

This is why we introduced the concept of "case paths" nearly [4 years ago][case-paths-first-ep]. 
Since then they have found use cases in many places, such as in the Composable Architecture, our
[parsing library][parsing-gh], vanilla [SwiftUI navigation][swiftui-nav-gh], and more.

However, the ergnomoics were never quite right. That all changed with Swift 5.9 was released, which
brought with it macros. They allow us to generate more correct and more performant case paths for
any enum, and we dedicated 2 episodes ([part 1][macro-case-paths-1] and 
[part 2][macro-case-paths-2]) to exploring how.

### Observable Architecture

## Open source

On average, our [open source libraries][pf-gh] are cloned over **120,000 times** per day! They are
used by thousands of developers and companies all across the globe. It's a lot of work to main them,
but it's all made possible thanks to our wonderful [subscribers][eoy-discount].

This year we released 4 new open source libraries, two of which were incubated in the
[Composable Architecture][tca-gh] and later split out, as well as dozens of updates to our
existing libraries:

<!--
38000+175000+48000+12000+52000+620000+18000+56000+85000+58000+112000
-->

### Dependencies

In October of last year we released a [large update][reducer-protocol-blog] to the Composable 
Architecture, introducing the `Reducer` protocol to the library. That simple change to the library
unlocked a whole new way to managing, controlling and propagating dependencies. It was extremely
powerful, and we soon realized that we could extract it out to its own library so that it could be
used in vanilla SwiftUI applications too.

And that's [exactly what we did][dependencies-blog] this year. We extracted the dependency 
management tool from the Composable Architecture, and open sourced it as its own standalone library:
[Dependencies][dependencies-gh]. It allows you to add dependencies to an observable object much like
you would with the environment in SwiftUI views.

The library even comes with a few dependencies you can use right away:

```swift
@Observable
final class FeatureModel {
  @Dependency(\.continuousClock) var clock  // Controllable way to sleep a task
  @Dependency(\.date.now) var now           // Controllable way to ask for current date
  @Dependency(\.mainQueue) var mainQueue    // Controllable scheduling on main queue
  @Dependency(\.uuid) var uuid              // Controllable UUID creation

  ‚Ä¶
}
```

Then, in your feature's logic you will use these dependencies rather than reaching out to their 
"live", uncontrollable versions:

```swift
@Observable
final class FeatureModel {
  ‚Ä¶

  func addButtonTapped() async throws {
    try await self.clock.sleep(for: .seconds(1))  // üëà Don't use 'Task.sleep'
    self.items.append(
      Item(
        id: self.uuid(),  // üëà Don't use 'UUID()'
        name: "",
        createdAt: self.now  // üëà Don't use 'Date()'
      )
    )
  }
}
```

And in tests you can override the dependencies so that that return something that you 
control rather than be at the mercy of the vagaries of the outside world. It's as easy as 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£,
3Ô∏è‚É£: 

```swift
func testAdd() async throws {
  let model = withDependencies {
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Override any dependencies that your feature uses.
    $0.clock = ImmediateClock()
    $0.date.now = Date(timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate: 1234567890)
    $0.uuid = .incrementing
  } operation: {
    // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Construct the feature's model
    FeatureModel()
  }

  // 3Ô∏è‚É£ The model now executes in a controlled environment of dependencies,
  //    and so we can make assertions against its behavior.
  try await model.addButtonTapped()
  XCTAssertEqual(
    model.items,
    [
      Item(
        id: UUID(uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")!,
        name: "",
        createdAt: Date(timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate: 1234567890)
      )
    ]
  )
}
```

### Concurrency extras

After finishing our series of episodes on [testing async code][testing-async-code-collection], we
[open sourced][concurrency-extras-gh] the tool we built during that series, as well as a few other 
tools.

The most improtant tool provided is [`withMainSerialExecutor`][withMainSerialExecutor-docs]. It 
serializes all async work in a scope so that you can predict how your feature will behave in tests: 

```swift
func testFeature() async {
  await withMainSerialExecutor {
    ‚Ä¶
  }
}
```

This makes it possible to write tests for features using async that pass deterministically 100%
of the time.

[concurrency-extras-gh]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-concurrency-extras

### Inline snapshot testing

We released our popular [snapshot testing][snapshot-testing-gh] library over 5 years ago, but this
year we added a huge new feature: [inline snapshot testing][inline-snapshot-testing-blog]. It
allows you to record the textual snapshot of your types directly into the test file.

For example, if you wanted to test the JSON encoding of a `user` value, you could do it like so: 

```swift
func testUserJSON() {
  assertInlineSnapshot(of: user, as: .json)
}
```

Upon running this test a snapshot of the `user` value will be made as JSON and automatically 
recorded directly into the test file:

```swift
func testUserJSON() {
  assertInlineSnapshot(of: user, as: .json)  {
    """
    {
      "id" : 42,
      "isAdmin": true,
      "name" : "Blob"
    }
    """
  }
}
```

It feels almost magical, but unfortunately static text in a blog post does not do it justice. This
is what it looks like when you run the test in Xcode:

![fullWidth](https://pointfreeco-blog.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/0113-inline-snapshot-testing/inline-snapshot.gif)

It's an extremely powerful testing tool, and it's even extensible so that you can build you own
testing tools on top of it. And in fact, that's exactly what we did for 
[testing macros](#Swift-macro-testing) in Swift. üëá

[snapshot-testing-gh]: https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
[inline-snapshot-testing-blog]: https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/113-inline-snapshot-testing

<div id="Swift-macro-testing"></div>

### Swift macro testing

One of the major new features of Swift 5.9 is macros. They are compiler plugins that can generate
code to be inserted into your code during the compilation process. It's an incredibly powerful tool
for removing boilerplate from your code and unlocking new techniques that would have previously
been too cumbersome.

Apple even ships a tool for testing macros, called `assertMacroExpansion`, but it can be cumbersome
to use. So we open sourced a new library, [MacroTesting][swift-macro-testing], that utilizes our
inline snapshot testing library to make testing macros super easy.

You can use the `assertMacro` function to provide a string of Swift code that makes use of a 
macro:

```swift
assertMacro {
  """
  @AddCompletionHandler
  func f(a: Int, for b: String) -> String {
    return b
  }
  """
}
```

When this test runs the expanded macro code will be automatically inserted into the test file. And
further, if the macro emits any diagnostics and/or fix-its, those too will be expanded and inserted
into the test file:

```swift
assertMacro {
  """
  @AddCompletionHandler
  func f(a: Int, for b: String) -> String {
    return b
  }
  """
} diagnostics: {
  """
  @AddCompletionHandler
  func f(a: Int, for b: String) -> String {
  ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
  ‚ï∞‚îÄ üõë can only add a completion-handler variant to an 'async' function
     ‚úèÔ∏è add 'async'
    return b
  }
  """
} fixes: {
  """
  @AddCompletionHandler
  func f(a: Int, for b: String) async -> String {
    return b
  }
  """
} expansion: {
  """
  func f(a: Int, for b: String) async -> String {
    return b
  }

  func f(a: Int, for b: String, completionHandler: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
    Task {
      completionHandler(await f(a: a, for: b, value))
    }
  }
  """
}
```

This makes it incredibly easy to test macros, which is important because macros can be very 
difficult to implement correctly. You have to deal with many of the edge cases of Swift syntax, 
and so it's a good idea to get as many tests as possible on the various subtle edge cases of the 
macro.
