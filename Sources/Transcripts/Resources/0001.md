[00:00:05] **Brandon:** OK, things are looking pretty good. Weâ€™ve cooked up new reducer operators that can hide away details, such as having an explicit `dismiss` action that can be sent when wanting to get rid of an alert, as well as automatically clearing out state when an alert is interacted with. It requires a little bit of upfront work to make use of this API, but the benefits really start to roll in once we consider testing. The Composable Architecture keeps us in check every step of the way to make sure that we are asserting on how your feature evolves.
