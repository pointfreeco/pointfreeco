      Last time we covered some basics with protocols, and demonstrated one of their biggest pitfalls: types can only conform to a protocol a single time. Sometimes it's valid and correct for a type to conform to a protocol in many ways. We show how to remedy this by demonstrating that one can scrap any protocol in favor of a simple datatype, and in doing so opens up a whole world of composability.

      Translate the `Equatable` protocol into an explicit datatype `struct Equating`.

  .init(
    problem: """
      Currently in Swift (as of 4.2) there is no way to extend tuples to conform to protocols. Tuples are what is
      known as "non-nominal", which means they behave differently from the types that you can define. For example, one
      cannot make tuples `Equatable` by implementing `extension (A, B): Equatable where A: Equatable, B: Equatable`.
      To get around this Swift implements overloads of `==` for tuples, but they aren't truly equatable, i.e.
      you cannot pass a tuple of equatable values to a function wanting an equatable value.

      However, protocol witnesses have no such problem! Demonstrate this by implementing the function
      `pair: (Combining<A>, Combining<B>) -> Combining<(A, B)>`. This
      function allows you to construct a combining witness for a tuple given two combining witnesses for each
      component of the tuple.
      """),

  .init(
    problem: """
      Functions in Swift are also "non-nominal" types, which means you cannot extend them to conform to protocols.
      However, again, protocol witnesses have no such problem! Demonstrate this by implementing the function
      `pointwise: (Combining<B>) -> Combining<(A) -> B>`. This allows you to construct
      a combining witness for a function given a combining witness for the type you are mapping into. There
      is _exactly_ one way to implement this function.
      """),

  .init(
    problem: """
      One of Swift's most requested features was "conditional conformance", which is what allows you to express,
      for example, the idea that an array of equatable values should be equatable. In Swift it is written
      `extension Array: Equatable where Element: Equatable`. It took Swift nearly 4 years after its launch
      to provide this capability!

      So, then it may come as a surprise to you to know that "conditional conformance" was supported for
      protocol witnesses since the very first day Swift launched! All you need is generics. Demonstrate this by
      implementing a function `array: (Combining<A>) -> Combining<[A]>`. This is saying that
      conditional conformance in Swift is nothing more than a function between protocol witnesses.
      """),

  .init(
    problem: """
      Currently all of our witness values are just floating around in Swift, which may make some feel
      uncomfortable. There's a very easy solution: implement witness values as static computed variables
      on the datatype! Try this by moving a few of the witnesses from the episode to be static variables. Also try
      moving the `pair`, `pointwise` and `array` functions to be static functions on the `Combining` datatype.
