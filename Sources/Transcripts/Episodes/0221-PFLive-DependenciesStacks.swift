          Yes we are, but progress on the actual implementation has been paused since we can't

          We hope that work can begin on it again someday soon, but we hope that when that day
          comes there will be a focus on the `embed` functionality and not just the `extract`.

          While the extraction of an associated value from an enum can be handy, it's only half the
          story. Just as key paths wouldn't be as useful if they only handled getting and not

          We feel that callback closures and delegates are really just two sides of the same coin.

          closures, versus conforming to a delegate protocol and holding onto a weak reference
          of that object. But, callback closures can be a little more lightweight and ergonomic
          than a delegate protocol.

          Further, Apple has even started shying away from the delegate protocol pattern in some
          of their more modern APIs, and instead opt for a simple collection of closures.
