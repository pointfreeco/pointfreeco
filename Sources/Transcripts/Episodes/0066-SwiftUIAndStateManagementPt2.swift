    problem: """
      SwiftUI provides another state management solution in the form of an [`@EnvironmentObject`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/environmentobject) property wrapper that, like `@ObjectBinding`, wraps a `BindableObject`, but rather than having to pass state via the view's initializer, you must instead inject the object using the `environmentObject` method on the root view (and on views that are presented modally or via presentation).

      Update the playground to use `@EnvironmentObject` instead of `@ObjectBinding`. What are some of the trade-offs between each strategy?
