          Once you modularize your code base you can begin uncovering new ways to speed up build times. This tool from Spotify allows you to cache and share build artifacts so that you can minimize the number of times you must build your project from scratch:

Improving build times is one of the most common requests for infrastructure teams and, as such, we constantly seek to improve our infrastructure toolchain.
