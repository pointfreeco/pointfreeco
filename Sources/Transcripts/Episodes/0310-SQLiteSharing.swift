      SQLite offers a lot of power and flexibility over a simple JSON file, but it also requires a \
      lot of boilerplate to get working. But we can hide away all that boilerplate using the \
      `@Shared` property wrapper and end up with something that is arguably nicer than Swift \
      Data's `@Query` macro!
