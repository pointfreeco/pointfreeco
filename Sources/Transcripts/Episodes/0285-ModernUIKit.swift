      We have built the foundation of powerful new UIKit navigation tools, but they're not quite \
      finished. Let's improve these APIs to handle dismissal by leveraging another SwiftUI tool: \
      bindings. We will see how SwiftUI bindings are (almost) the perfect tool for UIKit \
      navigation, and we will see where they fall short.
