    problem: #"""
      While it is not yet possible to abstract over a property wrapper in Swift, it _is_ possible to abstract over getting and setting a value in the form of key paths! Write a version of `synchronize` that works with writable key paths instead of bindings. What does the signature look like and what are some of the caveats?
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      This implementation is maybe not as straightforward as the ones that use bindings. This is because bindings are already bound to a specific instance of mutable state, but key paths are not. Because of this, we must reference this mutable state in addition to they key paths.

      Maybe we would pass a `Root` along:

      ```swift
      extension View {
        func synchronize<Root, Value>(
          _ root: Root,
          _ first: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Value>,
          _ second: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Value>
        ) -> some View
        where Value: Equatable {
          self
            .onChange(of: root[keyPath: first]) { root[keyPath: second] = newValue }
            .onChange(of: root[keyPath: second]) { root[keyPath: first] = newValue }
        }
      }
      ```

      This would work for a view with an `@ObservedObject` view model (or view store) and `@FocusState`, but would unfortunately not work for a `WithViewStore` helper. To support synchronizing state among two completely separate entities, we'd need to pass both values along:

      ```swift
      extension View {
        func synchronize<Root, Value>(
          _ first: Root,
          _ firstKeyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Value>,
          _ second: Root,
          _ secondKeyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Root, Value>
        ) -> some View
        where Value: Equatable { â€¦ }
      ```

      But now this is looking quite verbose, and perhaps it isn't pulling its weight.
