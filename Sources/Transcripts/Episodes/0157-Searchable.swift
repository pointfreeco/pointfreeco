      In the episode we were able to get by without having to wrap Apple's `MKMapItem` type, but let's now go the extra mile and do so by introducing our own `MapItem` type. How does controlling this type affect our application and test code?
      """#,
    solution: nil
  ),
  .init(
    problem: #"""
      Add an endpoint to `LocalSearchClient` that can perform a local search with a query string instead of a completion. The [`MKLocalSearch.Request`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mklocalsearch/request) type has a `naturalLanguageQuery` mutable field that does just this.

      WWDC introduced another search-related API that we didn't have time to explore, and that's the [`onSubmit(of:_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onsubmit(of:_:)/) view modifier, which evaluates an action closure when it detects a particular "submit trigger" is executed, which includes a "search" trigger:

      ```swift
      .onSubmit(of: .search) { â€¦ }
      ```

      Use this API to introduce the ability for a user to fire off a search by submitting the current query string to the local search endpoint from the previous exercise.

    solution: nil
  ),
  .init(
    problem: #"""
      Let's clean up the `LocalSearchClient` dependency. There are a few things we can fix and make nicer:

      * `MKLocalSearch.Request` has a `region` field that we've been ignoring, but we should pass the app's region to the dependency as input so that it can apply the region to the search request.

      * We have 2 separate endpoints for local search, but it might be nicer to unify this into a single interface to better match Apple's APIs.
