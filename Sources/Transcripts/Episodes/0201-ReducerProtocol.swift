        For the past many weeks we have gone deep into Swift’s concurrency tools, and then brought many of those tools into the Composable Architecture. This greatly improved the ergonomics for constructing complex effects, allowed us to tie the lifetime of effects to the lifetime of views, and amazingly everything remained 100% testable. In fact, we think that the Composable Architecture offers one of the most cohesive testing solutions for integrated asynchronous code in the entire Swift ecosystem.

        While we greatly improved the ergonomics of constructing complex effects, the ergonomics of constructing complex reducers hasn’t changed much since the library was first released over 2 years ago.

        Today we are going to start exploring what it means to put a protocol in front of our reducers. This will mean that instead of constructing a reducer by providing a closure that takes some state so that you can mutate it, you will instead create a type that conforms to the reducer protocol. And operators defined on reducers will return a whole new type rather than constructing a closure that calls out to other reducers under the hood.

        Now we want to stress that all the changes we discuss in this series of episodes, as well as everything in the final release of the library, is 100% backwards compatible with all of your existing Composable Architecture code. Once you upgrade to the newest version of the library, you will not need to make a single change to your code, and then later you can incrementally adopt these newer tools as you see fit. A few things will be soft-deprecated, which means it’s technically deprecated but we aren’t going to loudly warn about it yet, and then someday in the future we will fully deprecate, and then some day further into the future we will have an officially breaking change to remove some old cruft.

        We have released quite a bit of public code using the Composable Architecture, including the case studies and demos in this repo as well as our open-source word game, isowords. In all of those examples we mostly follow the pattern of defining the domain at the top of the file, which includes the state, action and environment. Abstractly, the domain looks like this:

        This style can make some people a little uncomfortable. First, some people see state, action and environment as making up one single unit, and so like to group them into some kind of namespace:
        """#,
      timestamp: (4 * 60 + 2),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""

      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        We personally prefer to use modules to group features in a “namespace”, and think it solves most of the problems this enum is trying to solve, but we also understand it’s not always possible or reasonable to organize things into modules.

      timestamp: (4 * 60 + 28),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Although this empty enum does act as a namespace, it is a little cumbersome. Because `Feature` is not used as a real type anywhere in the application, you often do not get the opportunity to elide it by using type inference. You usually have to fully qualify it with:
        """#,
      timestamp: (4 * 60 + 42),
      type: .paragraph
    ),

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        So, that’s a pattern that some people employ to ease their discomfort with not having the domain grouped into a single type, but even more people are bothered by the file-scope defined reducer variable:
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 0),
      type: .paragraph

      content: #"""
        People in the Swift community generally have some discomfort with file-scope variables and functions, especially non-private ones. They look like globals, but they aren’t really globals because Swift doesn’t have true globals. At the end of the day these kinds of variables are always at least scoped to the module, but still, the discomfort remains for many.

      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 10),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        So, one thing we could do is move the reducer to the `Feature` enum “namespace”, but then we have to make it a static:
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 26),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Another structure-related annoyance people encounter, especially with large, complex reducers, is where to put helpers that can be used in the reducer. For example, we may have two button tap actions in the UI that have some overlapping logic:
        """#,
      timestamp: (5 * 60 + 41),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

      type: .code(lang: .swift)
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Perhaps there’s a specific piece of state that gets mutated in the same way and a complex effect that is returned from both actions.
        """#,
      timestamp: (6 * 60 + 3),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        Well, one way to accomplish this is to have a little private helper function. If the helper needs to both mutate state and return an effect, it means you need to pass some `inout` state and the environment to it:
        """#,
      timestamp: (6 * 60 + 12),
      type: .paragraph
    ),

          ) -> Effect<Action, Never> {

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        …and then call that from the actions, in addition to whatever non-shared logic needs to be executed:
        """#,
      timestamp: (6 * 60 + 46),
      type: .paragraph
    ),
    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        switch action {
        case .buttonTapped:
          // additional button tap logic

          )
        case .otherButtonTapped:

          // additional other button tap logic

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(
      content: #"""
        This gets the job done, and is what we recommend in the Composable Architecture today, but it isn’t without its annoyances. We have to pass the state and environment to any helpers that do anything moderately interesting.

        This works, but is perhaps weird to throw such significant, behavioral logic on the value type representing the state. There is technically nothing technically wrong with it, but this style will probably make some people unconformable, and also, at the end of the day you still have to pass the environment to it if you want to return any effects.

        Something else we see people doing often is to share pieces of logic in a reducer by sending synchronous actions from effects. So, instead of having a `sharedButtonTapLogic` function, you would have a `sharedButtonTapLogic` action that houses the shared logic, and you would send that action from other actions:

        We highly recommend against this pattern. First of all this pattern isn’t as flexible as the other two styles we described. With the shared function or method we are able to call it before or after the additional logic we want to layer on, and we can even take just the state mutation or discard the effects, or take only the effects and discard the state mutation. We can even tweak the environment before calling the shared helper. In general, it’s just very flexible. Also, in the method and function style we could make those helpers private, yet with the synchronous action we are making it completely public to every parent layer above this feature.

        Currently the library comes with a variety of interesting operators that allow you to break large, complex units of logic into small units that can be pieced together. This includes the `pullback` operator for embedding a child feature into a parent feature, the `optional` operator for lifting a reducer on non-optional state to optional state, which can be great for driving navigation off of state, and the `forEach` operator for running a reducer on an entire collection of data, which is great for lists where each row has behavior of its own.

        The interesting thing about moving to a protocol for reducers is that we can explore what result builders have to say about composing reducers. SwiftUI is the most prototypical use case of result builders because it allows you to define a view hierarchy in a very natural way, but behind the scenes its building up a complex, nested type that encodes the view. We saw the same thing play out earlier this year where we turned to result builders to compose together lots of parsers to build up one big parser.

        And finally we could implement the feature reducer by combining a reducer that handles the core feature logic along with the modal reducer. However, to fit the modal reducer’s domain into the feature reducer’s domain we need to apply the `optional` operator in order to lift it from non-optional state to optional state, and then pull it back to the feature’s domain:

        It turns out that the order of combing reducers when dealing with the `optional` operator matters quite a bit.

That can cause subtle bugs that are hard to catch, and that’s why we display loud, runtime warnings when an action is sent to an optional reducer while the state is `nil`.

        It should be possible to add a dependency to a leaf feature without having to update every single feature that depends on it. And we should even be able to bake in some of the best practices for constructing dependencies, such as using “unimplemented” dependencies that simply fail if you ever invoke their endpoints. Such dependencies are great for proving that certain execution flows use only the dependencies you think they should, and in the future being notified when features start using new dependencies.

        There’s one last problem with how reducers are currently set up in the library, but it isn’t immediately obvious like some of the other things we’ve discussed. It has to do with performance and memory usage.

        Currently reducers are created by passing an escaping closure to a struct initializer. Swift does not inline and optimize escaping closures like it does for methods. We’ve seen this in very concrete terms in past episodes when we converted a `Parser` struct to a `Parser` protocol. We saw that by constructing deeply nested parser types representing complex parsers, Swift could optimize away most of the nesting, giving us a compact set of stack frames. On the other hand, nesting escaping closures could not be optimized. Each nested parser resulted in a few additional stack frames, and it resulted in a measurable performance hit.

        We would expect the same with reducers. To see this concretely, let’s quickly put a breakpoint in an action in the settings feature:

      type: .paragraph

    Episode.TranscriptBlock(

        When the breakpoint triggers we see that there are about 100 stack frames in the debugger. But worse, the stack frame where we send the action in the view is #65, which means we incurred the cost of 65 stack frames just to send an action.

        Moving to protocols will help us flatten and inline a lot of these frames. But even better, by flattening the stack frames that occur when sending actions we will also reduce the amount of memory on the stack. This will help people who need to hold a lot of data directly on the stack in the features.

        Well, luckily for us it’s possible to solve all of these problems, and more.
