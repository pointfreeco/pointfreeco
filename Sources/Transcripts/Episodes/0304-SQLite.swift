      We conclude our introductory series on SQLite by showing how to live update SwiftUI views
      powered by database using GRDB's "value observation." Along the way we will tackle quite a few
      Swift 6 concurrency issues, and we will tie things in a bow by showing how the SwiftUI
      environment can vastly simplify how our application is powered by SQLite.
