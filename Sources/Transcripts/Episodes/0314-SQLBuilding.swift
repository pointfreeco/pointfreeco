      Last week we released SharingGRDB, an alternative to SwiftData powered by SQLite, but there \
      are a few improvements we could make. Let's take a look at some problems with the current \
      tools before giving a sneak peek at the solution: a powerful new query building library that \
      leverages many advanced Swift features that we will soon build from scratch.
