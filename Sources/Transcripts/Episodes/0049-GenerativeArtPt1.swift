      Change the `bump` function we created in this episode so that it adds a bit of random noise to the curve. To do this you will want to change the signature so that it returns a function `(CGFloat) -> Gen<CGFloat>` instead of just a simple function `(CGFloat) -> CGFloat`. This will allow you to introduce random perturbations into the y-coordinate of the graph.
