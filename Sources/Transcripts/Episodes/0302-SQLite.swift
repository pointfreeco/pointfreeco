      Interfacing with SQLite's C library from Swift is possible, but clunky. Luckily there are
      friendlier, "Swiftier" interfaces the community has built, so let's take a look at the most
      popular: GRDB. We'll explore how it can help us avoid pitfalls and boilerplate required to use
      the C library, and how its typed SQL helpers can even help us avoid runtime issues at compile
      time.
