      What algebraic operation does the function type `(A) -> B` correspond to? Try explicitly enumerating
      all the values of some small cases like `(Bool) -> Bool`, `(Unit) -> Bool`, `(Bool) -> Three` and
      `(Three) -> Bool` to get some intuition.

      For every input, a function must assign a _single_ output. Viewed this way, we can enumerate implementations for the cited functions:

      `(Bool) -> Bool`

      - `true -> true, false -> true`
      - `true -> false, false -> false`
      - `true -> false, false -> true`
      - `true -> true, false -> false`

      ⇒ four inhabitants of `(Bool) -> Bool`.

      `(Unit) -> Bool`

      - `Unit() -> true`
      - `Unit() -> false`

      ⇒ two inhabitants of `(Unit) -> Bool`.

      `(Bool) -> Three`

      - `true` and `false` both need to be mapped onto `Three` ⇒ we have three choices for `true` and three for `false` ⇒ nine inhabitants of `(Bool) -> Three`.

      `(Three) -> Bool`

      Each member of `Three`—`.one`, `.two`, and `.three`—need to be mapped onto `Bool` ⇒ we have two choices per case, totaling at `2*2*2 = 2^3 = 8` inhabitants of `(Three) -> Bool`.

      More generally, functions from `A -> B` correspond to the cardinality of `B` raised to `A`’s cardinality, i.e. `B^A`.
