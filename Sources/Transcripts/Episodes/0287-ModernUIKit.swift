      We have now implemented tree-based navigation in UIKit, driven by the Observation framework, \
      but there is another form of navigation to think about: stack-based navigation, where you \
      drive your navigation from a flat collection of states rather than a heavily-nested type. \
      Let's leverage Observation to build a really nice tool for stack-based navigation.
