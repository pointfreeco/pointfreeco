      We've made testing in our architecture a joy! We can test deep aspects of our application with minimal ceremony, but it took us a whole 18 episodes to get here! So this week we ask: what's the point!? Can we write these kinds of tests in vanilla SwiftUI?

    problem: #"""
      Add tests for VanillaPrimeTime's `FavoritePrimesView`, starting with the logic around deleting favorite primes.
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      First, in `FavoritePrimesView`, extract the list's `onDelete` logic into a method.

      ```swift
      func deleteFavoritePrimes(_ indexSet: IndexSet) {
        for index in indexSet {
          let prime = self.favoritePrimes[index]
          self.favoritePrimes.remove(at: index)
          self.activityFeed.append(.init(timestamp: Date(), type: .removedFavoritePrime(prime)))
        }
      }
      ```

      Next, pass this method to `onDelete`.

      ```swift
      .onDelete(perform: self.deleteFavoritePrimes)
      ```

      Finally, write a test exercising this logic!

      ```swift
      func testFavoritePrimesView_deleteFavoritePrimes() {
        let view = FavoritePrimesView(
          favoritePrimes: Binding(initialValue: [2, 3, 5]),
          activityFeed: Binding(initialValue: [])
        )

        view.deleteFavoritePrimes([1])

        XCTAssertEqual(view.favoritePrimes, [2, 5])
      }
      ```
      """#
  ),
  Episode.Exercise(
    problem: #"""
      While `saveFavoritePrimes` and `loadFavoritePrimes` have been extracted to methods, what makes them difficult to test? What could be introduced to aid in testing? Consider the work done in our episode, [Testable State Management: Effects](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep83-testable-state-management-effects).
