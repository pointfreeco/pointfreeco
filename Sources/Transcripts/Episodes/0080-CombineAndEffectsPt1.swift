      The current version of `Effect` is "lazy": it is only evaluated the moment the `run` functions is called. Define an "eager" version of the `Effect` type that is evaluated the moment it is constructed.

      If you have any trouble defining such a type, consider the fact that in being eager, the work should be executed immediately, but call(s) to `run` may happen before _or_ after the work completes. This means:

      - A value must be set at some later time. Value types can only be mutated within a local, in-out scope, so you may need to reach for a class instead of a struct.

      - Because this value is being stored, you can cache it. This means the work only needs to be performed once.

      - There may be multiple requests for the value of a single effect. Ensure that both calls to `run` before the work has completed, as well as calls to `run` after the work has completed, feed the value to the callback. Keeping track of these calls may require introducing additional state.

    solution: #"""
      ```swift
      class Effect<A> {
        var callbacks: [(A) -> Void] = []
        var value: A?

        init(run: @escaping (@escaping (A) -> Void) -> Void) {
          run { value in
            self.callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(value) }
            self.value = value
          }
        }

        func run(_ callback: @escaping (A) -> Void) {
          if let value = self.value {
            callback(value)
          }
          self.callbacks.append(callback)
        }

    problem: #"""
      Continuing the previous exercise, improve the eager effect by making things thread-safe. To optimize for performance, you could use `os_unfair_lock` to protect access to the mutable storage that manages the resulting value and requests for it, but be wary of recursive calls to the lock by running the callbacks _outside_ of the lock.

      You could also use `NSRecursiveLock` to simplify this logic at the cost of some performance.
      """#,
    solution: #"""
      An example of `os_unfair_lock` is below. It synchronizes reads and writes to storage, and runs callbacks _outside_ of the lock in order to prevent recursive deadlocks.

      ```swift
      import Darwin

      class Effect<A> {
        var callbacks: [(A) -> Void] = []
        var value: A?
        var lock = os_unfair_lock()

        init(run: @escaping (@escaping (A) -> Void) -> Void) {
          run { value in
            let callbacks: [(A) -> Void]
            os_unfair_lock_lock(&self.lock)
            self.value = value
            callbacks = self.callbacks
            os_unfair_lock_unlock(&self.lock)
            callbacks.forEach { callback in callback(value) }
          }
        }

        func run(_ callback: @escaping (A) -> Void) {
          let value: A?
          os_unfair_lock_lock(&self.lock)
          if let aValue = self.value {
            value = aValue
          } else {
            value = nil
          }
          self.callbacks.append(callback)
          os_unfair_lock_unlock(&self.lock)
          if let value = value {
            callback(value)
          }
        }
      }
