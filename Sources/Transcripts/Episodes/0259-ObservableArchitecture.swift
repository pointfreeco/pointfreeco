      We're about to completely revolutionize the Composable Architecture with Swift's new
      Observation framework! But first, a sneak peek: we'll take the public beta (available today!)
      for a spin to see how the concept of a "view store" completely vanishes when using the new
      tools.

      Oh, and did we mention that the new observation tools in the library have been backported
      all the way back to iOS 13? This means you can use the tools _immediately_. ðŸ¤¯
