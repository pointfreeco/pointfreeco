      Let's apply the Composable Architecture's new state sharing tools to something even more \
      real world: our open source word game, isowords. It currently models its user settings as a \
      cumbersome dependency that requires a lot of code to keep features in sync when settings \
      change. We should be able to greatly simplify things with the `@Shared` property wrapper.
