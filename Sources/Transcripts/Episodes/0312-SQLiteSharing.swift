      We are now driving several features using SQLite using a simple property wrapper that offers \
      the same ergonomics as Swift Data's `@Query` macro, and automatically keeps the view in sync \
      with the database. Let's add one more feature to leverage _dynamic_ queries by allowing the \
      user to change how the data is sorted.
