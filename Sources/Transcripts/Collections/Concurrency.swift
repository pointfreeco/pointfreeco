      Swift has many tools for concurrency, including threads, operation queues, dispatch queues, Combine and now first class tools built directly into the language.

          The `Clock` protocol is the fundamental unit for expressing time-based asynchrony in
          Swift. It serves a similar purpose to Combine's `Scheduler` protocol, but is simpler
          and more powerful. Understanding this protocol and creating your own conformances can
          allow you to take control over time in your applications, rather than letting it control
          you.
