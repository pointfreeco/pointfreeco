  Swift’s generic functions allow us to explore a beautiful idea that straddles the line between mathematics \

  theorems, and show how this opens the doors to having the compiler verify properties of your program.

      Swift’s generic functions allow us to explore a beautiful idea that straddles the line between \
      mathematics and computer science. If you write down and implement a function using only generic data \
      types, there is a corresponding mathematical theorem that you have proven true. There are a lot of \

      It’s a function that takes an x in some type A (can be any type) and needs to return something in A. \
