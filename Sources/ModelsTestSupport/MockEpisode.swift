As server-side Swift becomes more popular and widely adopted, it will be important to re-examine some of the past “best-practices” of web frameworks to see how Swift’s type system can improve upon them.

A popular method for generating HTML is using so-called “templating languages”, for example Mustache and Handlebars. There is even one written in Swift for use with the Vapor web framework called Leaf. These libraries ingest plain text that you provide and interpolate values into it using tokens. For example, here is a Mustache (and Handlebar) template:

Templating languages will also provide simple constructs for injecting small amounts of logic into the templates. For example, an if statement can be used to conditionally show some elements:

The advantages of approaching views like this is that you get support for all that HTML has to offer out of the gate, and focus on building a small language for interpolating values into the templates. Some claim also that these templates lead to “logic-less” views, though confusingly they all support plenty of constructs for logic such as “if” statements and loops. A more accurate description might be “less logic” views since you are necessarily constricted by what logic you can use by the language.

The downsides, however, far outweigh the ups. Most errors in templating languages appear at runtime since they are usually not compiled. One can adopt a linting tool to find some (but not all) errors, but that is also an extra dependency that you need to manage. Some templating languages are compiled (like HAML), but even then the tooling is basic and can return confusing error messages. In general, it is on you to make these languages safe for you to deploy with confidence.

Furthermore, a templating language is just that: a language! It needs to be robust enough to handle what most users what to do with a language.

An alternative approach to views is using “embedded domain specific languages” (EDSLs).

We start by creating a type specifically to model keys that can be used in attributes. This type has two parts: the name of the key as a string (e.g. "id", "href", etc…), and the type of value this key is allowed to hold. There is a wonderful way to encode this latter requirement into the type system: you make the key’s type a generic parameter, but you don’t actually use it! Such a type is called a phantom type.
